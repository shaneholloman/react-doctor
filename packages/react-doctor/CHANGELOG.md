# react-doctor

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#756](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/756) [`93d4eec`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/93d4eecdb8e9e339f4258e67fcfc3649e2024ede) Thanks [@NisargIO](https://github.com/NisargIO)! - React Doctor now runs on repositories that don't depend on React. Previously a scan hard-failed with `No React project found` / `No React dependency`, even though many checks (security, bundle size, JS performance, architecture, and the Zod rules) are framework-agnostic and apply to any TypeScript / JavaScript codebase.

  A project is now analyzable when it has source files, with or without React. A bare directory of TypeScript files — including a monorepo's `packages/` subfolder that has no `package.json` of its own — is scanned by inheriting dependency/framework detection from the enclosing workspace root.

  React-flavoured rules stay off without React. A new `react` capability (set only when React or Preact is present) gates every React-runtime rule family (hooks, JSX, accessibility, render performance, React state) plus any rule tagged `react-jsx-only`, so hook/component-name heuristics like `rules-of-hooks`, `no-legacy-class-lifecycles`, and `no-nested-component-definition` can't false-fire on ordinary TypeScript. Once React (or Preact) is detected, every rule behaves exactly as before.

Scores come from Socket's free, keyless PURL endpoint (the same one the supply-chain check uses).

- [#747](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/747) [`a254414`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/a2544146668e8cbaa77d0d846eb252acf083a0ba) Thanks [@NisargIO](https://github.com/NisargIO)! - Add a Socket.dev supply-chain score check. Every direct dependency in `package.json` is scored against Socket's free, keyless PURL endpoint (the same lookup Socket Firewall's free tier uses) and any dependency whose Socket score falls below `supplyChain.minScore` (default `50`, 0–100 scale) produces a `Security` diagnostic anchored at the offending `package.json` entry. At the default `severity: "error"` a low score fails the scan at the standard `blocking` gate.

  The check runs by default; opt out with `supplyChain: { enabled: false }`. It is fail-open (per-package timeouts / network failures are skipped, never sinking the scan). A plain `--diff` / `--staged` scan skips it like the other whole-project checks, but a diff that edits a `package.json` (including any workspace's in a monorepo) still scores that project's dependencies — so a PR that adds or bumps a dependency is covered. `next` is excluded (its framework-specific risks are already covered by the Next.js / server-components rules).

### Patch Changes

- [#739](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/739) [`829655c`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/829655c4049342fc0b967e8c60c865f1586875a4) Thanks [@NisargIO](https://github.com/NisargIO)! - CI setup: collapsed the multi-line inline comments in the generated `.github/workflows/react-doctor.yml` to a single explanatory sentence per trigger and one line for the concurrency block, and dropped the permissions comment (the four well-named keys are self-explanatory). The resulting workflow still configures the same triggers, permissions, and action ref — just with less scrolling for new users.

- [#729](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/729) [`25cc69b`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/25cc69bd8fb64d395d33562439e8f50660f9b7b2) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Fold the standalone `doctor-explain` skill into the `react-doctor` skill as `references/explain.md`.

  Rule-explanation and config-tuning guidance now ships as an on-demand reference inside the primary skill (per the agentskills.io `references/` convention) instead of a separate sibling skill. `react-doctor install` installs a single skill, and the dead bundled-sibling-skill install machinery is removed.

- [#752](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/752) [`5b06a86`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/5b06a865faf1cb02acbd9492eeaa9abe92336aa7) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Name every unused dependency in the verbose warning tail.

  Unused-dependency warnings all report at the same line-less location (`package.json:0`), so the dim location header collapsed every finding into one line and dropped the package names — leaving only a generic `deslop/unused-dependency ×N` line ([#690](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/690)). `react-doctor --verbose` now lists each `deslop/unused-dependency` and `deslop/unused-dev-dependency` by name, with the shared "why" explanation shown once instead of repeated per package. Errors and code-frame rendering are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- [#721](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/721) [`d17dc87`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/d17dc87865e059f21534990d0925115db439dc3e) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Add a `defineConfig` helper for authoring a typed `doctor.config.{ts,js,mjs,cjs}` and read `react-doctor.config.json` as a deprecated fallback.

  `defineConfig` is exported from `react-doctor/api` (and `@react-doctor/api` / `@react-doctor/core`) as an identity helper that gives editor autocomplete and type-checking without an explicit `satisfies ReactDoctorConfig` annotation:

  ```ts
  // doctor.config.ts
  import { defineConfig } from "react-doctor/api";

  export default defineConfig({
    lint: true,
    rules: { "react-doctor/no-array-index-as-key": "off" },
  });
  ```

  The pre-migration `react-doctor.config.json` filename is now read as the lowest-priority fallback (after `doctor.config.*` and `package.json#reactDoctor`) instead of being ignored, so an un-migrated config keeps applying. It still emits a deprecation warning nudging a rename, and interactive runs continue to auto-migrate it to `doctor.config.ts`. A present-but-broken legacy file stops config resolution (it won't silently inherit an ancestor repo's config), and `react-doctor rules <...>` migrates a legacy file to `doctor.config.json` on write rather than editing it in place.

  Note: a `react-doctor.config.json` that was previously ignored in non-interactive runs (CI, coding agents, `--json`/`--score`/`--staged`) is now honored again, which can change which rules fire, the score, and PR gating for projects that still have one. Rename it to `doctor.config.json` (or delete it) to avoid surprises.

### Patch Changes

- [#711](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/711) [`36ecd05`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/36ecd053cfe22e16678ac2ff307e015b6f9a2859) Thanks [@devin-ai-integration](https://github.com/apps/devin-ai-integration)! - Fix false positive in `require-reduced-motion`: the check now searches untracked files so newly created source (e.g. a `providers.tsx` with `<MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">` not yet committed) is detected.

- [#706](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/706) [`15bd9d8`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/15bd9d861703c6d3b0e2fd8ffad82b7b6a922b00) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - CI setup now offers a one-time, per-repo prompt to upgrade an existing React Doctor GitHub Actions workflow from `@v1` to `@v2` — accepting opens a PR with the bump, declining is remembered so it never asks again. The generated / "Add to CI" workflow now pins `millionco/react-doctor@v2` and grants `statuses: write`, so the action can publish the score as a commit status (and surface results on pushes to the default branch).

### Minor Changes

- [#663](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/663) [`9a8ad6e`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/9a8ad6e40d9ed1fbe7ddb1f1c57bfd5c791a4b9e) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Rework CI reporting: a renamed `blocking` gate, PR-introduced-issues-only baselines, inline PR review comments, and a simpler CLI flag surface.

  **CI gate**

  - **`fail-on` is renamed to `blocking`** (CLI `--blocking <level>`, config `blocking`, GitHub Action `blocking` input). Same `error | warning | none` values, default `error`: a scan fails CI when an `error`-severity diagnostic reaches the `ciFailure` surface; `warning` blocks on any diagnostic; `none` stays advisory (always exits 0). `--fail-on` / `failOn` still work as a deprecated, warned alias hidden from `--help`.
  - `--blocking warning` now wins over `--no-warnings` (it previously silently no-op'd the gate — you can't block on warnings you've hidden).

  **Baseline — report only the issues a PR introduces (Codecov-style)**

  - In `--diff <base>` mode, react-doctor runs a second lint pass over the changed files as they existed at the base merge-base and reports only the diagnostics the change introduced; pre-existing findings that merely shifted lines are matched out by a content fingerprint (`file + rule + flagged-line hash`). The head project-health **score is unchanged**; the gate fails on newly-introduced errors only. If the baseline can't be computed (base unreachable, or a lint pass failed), the run degrades to a plain diff — all findings stay visible and CI isn't gated on findings whose new-vs-pre-existing attribution is unknown.
  - **New core API:** `computeDiagnosticDelta`, `Git.showRefContent` / `Git.mergeBase`, `materializeSourceTree`, and `InspectOptions.baseline` / `InspectResult.baselineDelta`.
  - **JSON report v2:** baseline runs emit `schemaVersion: 2` with a `baseline` block (`newCount`, `fixedCount`, `baseTotalCount`) and `mode: "baseline"`; `summary.score` stays the head score. v1 reports are unchanged.

  **GitHub Action**

  - Posts **inline PR review comments** on the changed lines that triggered each diagnostic (with fix guidance + a docs link), plus a restyled CLI-style sticky summary with linkable findings and the new / fixed delta. The `annotations` input was removed.
  - On pull requests it fetches the base commit for baselining — use `fetch-depth: 0` on `actions/checkout`. New `fixed-issues` output. Defaults: `project: "*"`, `node-version: 24`.

  **CLI flags (fewer flags, fewer footguns)**

  - `--explain` / `--why` → the `react-doctor why <file>:<line>` subcommand (`rules explain <rule>` still explains what a rule means).
  - Removed `--full` (use `--diff false` to force a full scan), `--pr-comment` (the Action renders its comment from `--json`), and the positive `--respect-inline-disables` (already the default; use `--no-respect-inline-disables` for audit mode). The internal `--changed-files-from` is hidden from `--help`.
  - Removed flags now fail with a migration error instead of being silently dropped, and an empty `--project` filter (e.g. `--project ","`) is rejected.

### Patch Changes

- [#681](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/681) [`915745e`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/915745ef7b88730e153d93bf52ce48bce2806495) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Add `react-doctor experimental-lsp`, an experimental language server that surfaces React Doctor diagnostics directly in your editor — VS Code, Cursor, Zed, Neovim, Sublime Text, Emacs, Helix, or any LSP client. It is gated behind the `experimental-` prefix while its protocol, caching, and diagnostics stabilize. It scans the file you are editing live from the unsaved buffer, underlines the exact offending token via precise ranges, shows rich hovers (rule, category, recommendation, docs link), and offers quick fixes (disable-for-this-line with the correct comment style, suppress-all-in-file, explain, open docs, report false positive). It discovers every React project across workspace folders and monorepo packages, runs offline (no score lookup, no git), prioritizes open-buffer scans, supports push and pull diagnostics, and invalidates caches when config / package.json / lockfiles change. The background workspace scan is chunked so diagnostics stream in progressively (seconds to first results on large repos), parallelizes across all CPU cores, reserves a slot so edits stay responsive while it runs, and cancels in-flight work when config changes. Results are cached per file (by content metadata, invalidated on config change) and persisted to disk, so re-opening the editor or re-scanning surfaces diagnostics almost instantly — on an ~8,800-file repo a cold scan is ~27s and a warm scan ~2s.

  Start it with `react-doctor experimental-lsp --stdio` (or `npx react-doctor@latest experimental-lsp --stdio`). A `scanOnType` initialization option toggles live-as-you-type scanning, with first-class companion extensions for VS Code/Cursor and Zed.

  Like the CLI, the language server reports anonymized usage analytics to Sentry — a per-workspace-scan wide event plus session/scan counters — sharing the CLI's IP-stripping and path/secret scrubbing. Opt out with `REACT_DOCTOR_NO_TELEMETRY=1` (or by launching it with `--no-telemetry`).

### Minor Changes

- [#658](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/658) [`cbdff62`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/cbdff6203d8ebb95adeea2c875938a6d811259bd) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Add an "Add to CI" path to the post-scan handoff and make `install` set up CI by default.

  The post-scan prompt now leads with an "Add to CI" choice (the default) that installs the `react-doctor` dev dependency + `doctor` script and writes a `.github/workflows/react-doctor.yml` GitHub Actions workflow so every pull request is scanned. When you instead hand off to an agent, the generated prompt now asks the agent to offer CI setup first. The `install` subcommand pre-selects the workflow and `install --yes` now writes it by default. The workflow's action is pinned to the `@v1` floating major (never `@main`, per the supply-chain guidance in issue [#299](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/299)).

### Patch Changes

- [#676](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/676) [`08e1d55`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/08e1d55da45d8b4afae1861484b2366743871e31) Thanks [@devin-ai-integration](https://github.com/apps/devin-ai-integration)! - `react-doctor --full --yes` no longer errors with "Cannot combine --yes and --full; pick one."

  `--yes` (skip prompts, scan all workspace projects) and `--full` (force a full scan, overriding any `diff` value) control orthogonal concerns, so combining them is a valid request — "scan every workspace project fully, without prompting." The mutual-exclusion check that rejected the pair has been removed.

- [#674](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/674) [`6851a78`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/6851a786e57e875fe4e9afbbd239397e99bf854b) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Bump bundled `deslop-js` to `^0.0.17`, which stops `deslop/unused-dev-dependency` from false-positiving on dependencies referenced in a `package.json` script as a flag argument rather than the leading command — e.g. `jest --testResultsProcessor jest-sonar-reporter` or `--reporters=jest-junit` ([#653](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/653)).

- [#668](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/668) [`3c05fc4`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/3c05fc4d63993055469e8c8a18f151ba95a3a36e) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Update the dead-code analysis engine (`deslop-js`) to `0.0.16`.

- [#655](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/655) [`d594f69`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/d594f69f26efaab9b2d0a78140ff97a3ff497ab0) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - react-doctor no longer crashes when the `--changed-files-from` file can't be read.

  `--changed-files-from <file>` is user input, so an unreadable file — missing, a directory, permission-denied, or a stale pipe/process-substitution descriptor (`EBADF`, REACT-DOCTOR-V) — is an invocation mistake, not a bug. It now exits non-zero with a clean, single-line message telling you to pass a readable text file, instead of printing the generic "Something went wrong" block and reporting the read failure to Sentry.

- [#660](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/660) [`e3b106e`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/e3b106e19156ddc508b92c80776237e3ebce1453) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - react-doctor now records a single anonymized per-scan "wide event" on its Sentry run span — the full run/CI/project/outcome context (scan mode, score, diagnostics by severity and category, top rule, lint/dead-code state, and, in CI, the GitHub event, an official-action marker, the forwarded action inputs, and the pull-request gate) — so usage and CI behavior can be analyzed by querying spans instead of pre-aggregated counters.

  It also mints a random per-run `runId` attached to the Sentry run context (never as a tag or metric dimension) to correlate the spans of a single run. Telemetry stays anonymized — no repo, owner, username, branch, or path is sent to Sentry — and `--no-score` / `--no-telemetry` still opts out entirely. The official GitHub Action forwards its inputs (fail-on, non-blocking, comment, annotations, version) so action configuration is visible in telemetry.

- [#658](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/658) [`cbdff62`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/cbdff6203d8ebb95adeea2c875938a6d811259bd) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Polished the first-run onboarding experience — the animated welcome scene now plays on every interactive regular-mode run (not just the first) but at half the cadence for returning users (`hasCompletedOnboarding()`), `--verbose` skips the intro entirely and goes straight to the static branded header, and the closing `"Let's scan your codebase..."` typewriter beat was cut so the intro ends on the tagline.

  Restructured the scan-report layout so the top-errors detail (code frames + fixes) leads the report and the per-category breakdown moves down as a wrap-up overview directly above the score. The breakdown now has its own bold `All N issues` header (mirroring `Top N errors you should fix`) with the total folded into the header text, categories sort in a fixed Security → Bugs → Performance → Accessibility → Maintainability order, and warnings no longer get boxed code frames in `--verbose` (errors still do) so a long warning tail stops drowning the report. The trailing `--verbose` CTA drops the redundant `+N more rules and +N optional warnings` stats (the breakdown above already carries those) and reads as a clean `Run npx react-doctor@latest --verbose to list every error and warning`.

  Quieted the "Add to CI" handoff: it no longer runs the local dev-dep install (the `doctor` package script and the GitHub workflow both invoke `npx react-doctor@latest`, so a local copy adds nothing and on pnpm with a beta channel it noisily trips the supply-chain trust guard for zero user benefit). The trust-policy skip on the `react-doctor install` path now renders as a yellow `⚠` warning with a tightened one-liner and a dim follow-up showing the manual install command, instead of a red `✖` that read like a crash next to its own "React Doctor still works" reassurance.

  Made the case for GitHub Actions before the handoff prompt instead of after it. The scan-report footer now closes with a `GitHub Actions: https://react.doctor/ci` entry (matching the `Share` / `Docs` / `GitHub` bold label + dim description shape) carrying the strongest reasons in two short lines: `Scan every pull request: new PRs stay clean while you fix the backlog` + `Used by teams at PayPal, Rippling, and Alibaba`. Sitting last in the footer makes it the final thing read before the handoff prompt that recommends the same action. The prompt's choice reads as `Add to GitHub Actions (recommended)` (or `(already configured)`) with a description of what gets set up; the state tag lives in the title so the description always describes what the option _does_, not the project's current state. The post-pick message drops the social-proof + backlog framing (now redundant — the footer already showed it) and just confirms what changed plus the docs link.

  The recursive subproject crawl reads directories best-effort and already skipped ones it couldn't open for permission or missing-path reasons (`EACCES`/`EPERM`/`ENOENT`/`ENOTDIR`). It now also skips directories the underlying filesystem rejects outright — `EINVAL` on `scandir` (REACT-DOCTOR-N, seen on special/virtual mounts), plus symlink loops (`ELOOP`) and over-long paths (`ENAMETOOLONG`) — instead of throwing and reporting the environment issue to Sentry. The crawl continues past the unreadable directory.

- [#666](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/666) [`5d7b36b`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/5d7b36bc315ba4c0a8ba6b60bd781a11efbed94f) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Retires `rn-animate-layout-property`. Reanimated `useAnimatedStyle` runs entirely on the UI thread, so layout-affecting style animations driven by helpers like `withTiming` or `withSpring` are valid and should not be flagged.

- [#645](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/645) [`4aadaab`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/4aadaabfd488055a4323cc8b7f816c75601e40f1) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Two React Native rules no longer false-positive on Expo Universal UI (`@expo/ui`).

  `@expo/ui` is a native UI layer (it delegates to SwiftUI / Jetpack Compose), not React Native's core primitives, so several RN-core assumptions don't hold for its components:

  - **`rn-no-raw-text`**: Universal UI's `<ListItem>` renders its raw string children inside the native headline text area, and its compound slot markers (`<ListItem.Leading>`, `<ListItem.Supporting>`, `<ListItem.Trailing>`) forward strings into native text too — so raw text inside them is safe, unlike React Native's core `<View>`. The rule now recognizes them as text-handling.
  - **`rn-no-scrollview-mapped-list`**: Universal UI's `<ScrollView>` is a native scroll container; React Native's virtualized lists (`FlashList`/`FlatList`) can't compose inside its `<Host>` tree, and `@expo/ui` ships its own virtualized `<List>`. The rule no longer flags mapped children inside an `@expo/ui` `ScrollView`.

  Both checks are gated on the `@expo/ui` import (root, `@expo/ui/swift-ui`, or `@expo/ui/jetpack-compose`, including renamed and namespace imports), so same-named components from other libraries — or with no import — still report.

- [#672](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/672) [`8e7fb33`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/8e7fb3366fc4b56a60bceb97195309f782c51541) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - `prefer-module-scope-static-value` ("Static value rebuilt every render") is now disabled when React Compiler is enabled.

  React Compiler already hoists and caches per-render array/object allocations, so both halves of the recommendation — avoid the re-allocation and preserve referential equality for memoized children — are handled automatically, making the warning pure noise on a compiler-enabled codebase ([#669](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/669)). The rule now carries `disabledBy: ["react-compiler"]`, matching the `jsx-no-new-*-as-prop` rules that gate on the same capability.

When the terminal/PTY backing a prompt goes away mid-read (closing the tab, a dropped SSH/tmux session, sleep/wake), Node raises `read EIO` on the raw-mode stdin handle; the CLI now exits cleanly (code 129) instead of surfacing it as a fatal uncaught exception and reporting it to crash telemetry. Genuine stdin errors still funnel to the error reporter unchanged.

- [#673](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/673) [`68a0bef`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/68a0befa1a688d591ddeeefe03b334c515654942) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - `no-wide-letter-spacing` no longer false-positives on uppercase labels styled through a wrapper component prop.

  The rule exempts wide tracking on uppercase text, but it could only see `textTransform: 'uppercase'` written inline in the same style object. Design-system text components routinely apply the transform from a prop instead (`<SSText uppercase style={{ letterSpacing: 2 }}>`), which the rule can't see inside the component ([#671](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/671)). It now also treats a sibling `uppercase` boolean prop or a `textTransform="uppercase"` prop on the same element as the uppercase signal, so those short labels stay quiet.

### Patch Changes

- [#640](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/640) [`b336f54`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/b336f54d664bf49e0c7b9575b7dcd374eebfd9c6) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - The interactive category breakdown now reveals issues one at a time — a category's errors before its warnings, top to bottom — instead of every count easing up in parallel, holds for a beat once it settles, and finally plays on monorepo (multi-project) scans too.

  Previously the count-up only animated on single-project scans; the multi-project aggregate report rendered the breakdown (and the score projection) statically. Both now share the same interactive reveal, gated on the same real-TTY predicate, so a monorepo's report animates like a single project's. Small and medium breakdowns step one issue per frame; very large ones grow the per-step increment so the reveal still resolves quickly.

- [#643](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/643) [`0c8b797`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/0c8b797d18d7d8d0b347fbea0da111b38075eb5d) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - react-doctor no longer crashes when `git` isn't installed.

  During a normal scan, diff auto-detection reads the current branch first. When the `git` binary couldn't be spawned (e.g. a bare container with no git on `PATH`), that best-effort read threw instead of degrading, crashing the scan and reporting an environment issue to Sentry (REACT-DOCTOR-F). It now degrades to "unknown branch" — matching how a non-zero `git` exit was already handled — so the scan continues without git context.

- [#642](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/642) [`2aa96f3`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/2aa96f39b56555722b7121569a5bbd9caa10dc44) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Expected, user-actionable failures are no longer reported to Sentry or rendered as crashes.

  When react-doctor exits because of the user's project or invocation — not a bug — it now prints a clean, single-line message and exits non-zero, instead of the generic "Something went wrong, open a prefilled issue" block. These cases are also no longer sent to Sentry or counted in the alertable error-rate metric. This was flooding crash reporting with non-bugs from CI, coding agents, and sandboxes.

  Covered cases:

  - **No React / no project / missing path** — every project-discovery failure (`NoReactDependencyError`, `ProjectNotFoundError`, `PackageJsonNotFoundError`, `NotADirectoryError`, `AmbiguousProjectError`) is now treated as a clean user error (REACT-DOCTOR-1, -4, -6, -7). When the scan target simply doesn't exist on disk, the message now says the path doesn't exist instead of the misleading "Expected a package.json…" guidance.
  - **CLI invocation mistakes** — a malformed `<file>:<line>` argument, mutually exclusive flags (e.g. `--yes` + `--full`), and an unknown `--project` name now render as clean errors (REACT-DOCTOR-B, -D, -G, -H).
  - **Read-only config directory** — react-doctor no longer crashes when it can't create/read its global setup-prompt store on a locked-down or read-only filesystem; it degrades gracefully (REACT-DOCTOR-E).

  The fix is enforced centrally in `reportErrorToSentry`, so the CLI entry point, `inspect`, and `install` all benefit.

### Patch Changes

- [#638](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/638) [`114893e`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/114893e07d83d143aa3cdddc9fb178137b786f47) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Redesigned the interactive scan report and added a first-run onboarding reveal.

  The default single-project report now reads top-to-bottom the way a human scans it: the category tally, then the score box (with the total issue count inline on the score line, e.g. `7 / 100 Critical   295 issues`), the projection, the top fixes one by one, the warning roll-up, a single merged `+N more errors and +N more warnings` overflow line, and finally Share / Docs / Tip. The per-section `+N more rules` lines, the `N warnings` sub-header, and the `Top N errors you should fix` header were removed for a cleaner read. CI, coding-agent, git-hook, and verbose runs keep the classic information-dense layout (diagnostics first, then agent guidance and score).

  On a user's first interactive run it plays as an onboarding sequence: a happy React Doctor "welcome" scene opens, the scan runs, the category tallies count up from zero in parallel, and then each section — and each of the top errors — reveals on an ~850ms beat (quickening to ~680ms once the score lands) instead of a wall of text. It runs only once (a marker persisted in the global config records that it was shown), and is skipped entirely in CI, under coding agents, and on any non-TTY / score-only / JSON run.

### Patch Changes

- [#637](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/637) [`8162bfb`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/8162bfb7ca0948b137dd75a22776e55cab99b740) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Redesign the scan output's summary and footer. The default (non-verbose) run no longer lists every warning rule — warnings are rolled into a single overflow line alongside the hidden errors (e.g. `+4 more rules and +50 optional warnings — run npx react-doctor@latest --verbose for details`). `--verbose` now renders warnings in the same boxed, titled, code-framed format as errors (with a "Learn more" docs link), instead of a separate compact list. The closing footer is restructured into a `Share:` / `Docs:` / `GitHub:` block (each with a one-line description) separated by a divider, and the share link now appears for monorepo runs too (gated the same way as single-project: shown unless CI, `--no-score`, or `share: false`). The scan spinner's worker count now reads as a dimmed `[~N workers]`.

- [#633](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/633) [`520b0a9`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/520b0a9235d37074821c12fd73455d8462128a75) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - `--diff` now accepts git commit ranges, and a bad `--diff` value is no longer treated as a crash.

  - `--diff A..B` (two-dot, diff A directly against B) and `--diff A...B` (three-dot, diff from the merge-base of A and B to B) are now supported, matching git's own range syntax — an empty endpoint defaults to `HEAD` (`main..` ⇒ `main..HEAD`). Previously any value containing `..` was rejected outright, so `react-doctor --diff 7694215..c4de712` failed. Each range endpoint is still individually validated against the anti-injection guard, so a range can't smuggle a `--upload-pack=…`-style option past it.
  - An invalid `--diff` value (a malformed ref/range or a base branch that hasn't been fetched) is now rendered as a clean, single-line message and exits non-zero — it no longer prints the generic "Something went wrong, open a prefilled issue" block or reports the expected user error to Sentry.

- [#635](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/635) [`bd8298d`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/bd8298d6cf3484ef7f2898fe981442706ffea3ce) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Lint in parallel by default. React Doctor now fans the lint pass across your CPU cores out of the box (previously serial) and automatically falls back to a single worker if a parallel run exhausts system resources (`EAGAIN`/`EMFILE`/`ENFILE`/`ENOMEM`); any other failure still surfaces. Pass `--no-parallel` (or set `REACT_DOCTOR_PARALLEL=0`) to force serial linting, or set `REACT_DOCTOR_PARALLEL=<n>` to pin a worker count. The experimental `--experimental-parallel` flag is replaced by `--no-parallel`.

- [#634](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/634) [`17e722e`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/17e722ee074d10a5c4082b9f0a6b40ccaf3bed3b) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Add anonymized Sentry Application Metrics (counters + distributions) to the CLI, alongside the existing crash reporting and tracing, so we can track reliability/performance and prioritize work.

  - **Counters & distributions**: each run records `cli.invoked` (per command), `scan.completed`, `scan.duration`/`scan.files`/`scan.score`, `project.detected` (anonymous project shape), `rule.fired` (a per-rule counter keyed by `rule`/`plugin`/`category`/`severity`, so we can see which rules actually catch issues, which are noisy, and which never fire), `lint.failed`/`deadcode.failed`/`scan.check_skipped`/`score.unavailable`, `cli.error`, plus growth/activation signals on `install` (which coding agents, git hook, CI workflow, agent hooks, dependency outcome), the agent-handoff fix loop (`agent.handoff`), and `rules` config changes (`rules.changed`/`rules.queried`).
  - **Trace-connected & enabled by default**: metrics use `Sentry.metrics.*` (SDK ≥ 10.25), flow independently of `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`, and carry the run snapshot + project shape (rebuilt per emit, mirroring the per-event run tags).
  - **Anonymized by default**: a `beforeSendMetric` hook drops the `server.address` hostname attribute and scrubs home-directory paths + known secrets from attribute values via the same redactor used for events, dropping the metric on failure. Attributes are enums/booleans/counts/rule names only — no source code or specific findings.
  - **Opt-out unchanged**: `--no-score` (and its `--no-telemetry` alias) disables metrics along with crash reporting and tracing; metrics are skipped under test runs, and the programmatic `@react-doctor/api` library never initializes Sentry.

### Patch Changes

- [#612](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/612) [`3ceb748`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/3ceb7480c1f1b61a45a728274940f9e3de74a462) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Stop flagging known public client keys in `no-secrets-in-client-code`. Keys that vendors design to ship in the browser bundle — RevenueCat public SDK keys (`appl_`/`goog_`/`amzn_`/`strp_`), Stripe/Clerk publishable keys (`pk_live_`/`pk_test_`), Supabase publishable keys (`sb_publishable_`), PostHog project keys (`phc_`), Stytch public tokens (`public-token-`), and Mapbox public access tokens (`pk.`) — are now allowlisted, so the variable-name heuristic no longer reports them as hardcoded secrets. Ambiguous shapes that can be either public or sensitive (Google/Firebase `AIza…` browser keys, and bare Supabase `anon`/`service_role` JWTs) are intentionally still flagged.

- [#596](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/596) [`6e59f10`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/6e59f10ef8b2173f0c98a653b13702d84f6471e7) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Diagnostic ranking now depends solely on the score API's per-rule priority. The hand-rolled severity/category-stakes weighting (and the offline priority midpoints) is gone: when the API priority is unavailable (`--no-score`, offline, or API failure) rules and categories keep their scan order, with categories falling back to alphabetical for determinism.

- [#619](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/619) [`b3c3aa9`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/b3c3aa94018bfde765431f6a5612435c621eb925) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Treat `CI=1` and `CI=True` as CI environments, not just `CI=true`. CI-only behavior (suppressing the share URL, marking the run as CI-originated for scoring) now triggers consistently across providers that set `CI` to a truthy value other than the literal string `"true"`; explicit `CI=false` / `CI=0` are still treated as non-CI.

  A present-but-unparseable `react-doctor.config.json` at the scanned root no longer silently falls through to a parent directory's config. The tool stops there instead of letting an ancestor repo's config govern the project; a `package.json` `reactDoctor` config in the same directory is still used as a fallback.

- [#605](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/605) [`4861f37`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/4861f37a55eb12909c7faca170ec5c9fd636f9a9) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Update the dead-code analysis engine (`deslop-js`) to `0.0.14` so the published CLI's unused-file / dead-code detection runs on the latest release. The CLI previously pinned `^0.0.13` while the internal core engine was already on `0.0.14`; this aligns both on a single version and drops the duplicate from the lockfile.

- [#596](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/596) [`6e59f10`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/6e59f10ef8b2173f0c98a653b13702d84f6471e7) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Collapse diagnostic categories into five clear, outcome-based buckets: **Security**, **Bugs**, **Performance**, **Accessibility**, and **Maintainability**. The previous fine-grained labels (Correctness, State & Effects, React Compiler, Next.js, React Native, Server, TanStack Query/Start, Preact → Bugs; Bundle Size → Performance; Architecture/Design → Maintainability) now roll up so the scan output reads as plain issue types at a glance.

  This changes the `category` value on every diagnostic (CLI output, the per-error headline prefix like `Security: Use of eval()`, and JSON/programmatic output). If you key `categories` severity overrides off the old names, update them to the new buckets. Dead-code findings (unused files/exports/dependencies, circular imports) now report `Maintainability` instead of `Dead Code`. Bundle-size findings now sort with `Performance` (higher stakes) rather than near the bottom of the top-errors block.

- [#623](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/623) [`b9e9bcb`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/b9e9bcbc08985f4bd77df1f354713d2cdbdaf2ec) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Align the CLI with the clig.dev and 12-factor CLI guidelines:

  - `--color` / `--no-color` flags force or disable colored output, with app-specific `REACT_DOCTOR_NO_COLOR` / `REACT_DOCTOR_FORCE_COLOR` env overrides. Flags win over env vars, which win over picocolors' built-in `NO_COLOR` / `FORCE_COLOR` / `TERM` / TTY detection; the preference is resolved before parsing so it reaches every surface (scan report, branded header, score, prompts, errors).
  - `react-doctor --help` and `react-doctor install --help` now lead with worked examples and link to where to report feedback.
  - New `react-doctor version` subcommand prints the version with Node and platform info (e.g. `react-doctor/0.2.14 darwin-arm64 node-v24.14.0`); `-v` / `-V` / `--version` stay terse for scripts.
  - `react-doctor help` and `react-doctor help <command>` now show help instead of failing by trying to scan a directory named "help".

- [#583](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/583) [`4bc8a73`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/4bc8a73d247d9b8378616e738780af3794f0b97f) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Port expo-doctor's project-level checks as Expo-gated diagnostics. When an Expo project is detected (`expoVersion !== null`), react-doctor now runs the statically-determinable subset of expo-doctor's check suite during the environment-checks phase (skipped in diff/staged mode):

  - `expo-no-unimodules-packages` — legacy `@unimodules/*` / `react-native-unimodules` packages (IllegalPackageCheck).
  - `expo-no-cli-dependencies` — `expo-cli` / `eas-cli` listed as project dependencies (GlobalPackageInstalledLocallyCheck).
  - `expo-no-redundant-dependency` — packages Expo installs transitively or that were removed/deprecated (`expo-modules-core`, `@expo/metro-config`, `@types/react-native`, `expo-permissions`, the `expo-firebase-*` family, …), each SDK-version gated (DirectPackageInstallCheck).
  - `expo-no-conflicting-dependency-override` — `overrides`/`resolutions`/`pnpm.overrides` that pin SDK-critical packages like `@expo/cli` or `metro*` (DependencyVersionOverrideCheck).
  - `expo-router-no-react-navigation` — direct `@react-navigation/*` alongside `expo-router` on the SDK 56 line only (`>=56 <57`, matching expo-doctor's range) (ExpoRouterReactNavigationCheck).
  - `expo-vector-icons-conflict` — scoped icon packages mixed with `@expo/vector-icons` / `react-native-vector-icons` (VectorIconsCheck).
  - `expo-package-json-conflict` — `expo`/`react-native` scripts shadowing node_modules bins, and a package name colliding with a dependency (PackageJsonCheck).
  - `expo-lockfile` — missing or multiple lock files at the workspace root (LockfileCheck).
  - `expo-gitignore` — a committed `.expo/` directory, or local module native dirs that are gitignored (ProjectSetupCheck).
  - `expo-env-local-not-gitignored` — committed `.env*.local` files (EnvLocalFilesCheck).
  - `expo-metro-config` — a metro config that doesn't extend `expo/metro-config`, while tolerating known wrappers that extend it internally such as Sentry's `getSentryExpoConfig` (MetroConfigCheck).

  The remaining expo-doctor checks require running the Expo CLI, querying the Expo API, or inspecting native iOS/Android projects — none of which fit react-doctor's offline, static model — so they're intentionally out of scope.

- [#583](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/583) [`4bc8a73`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/4bc8a73d247d9b8378616e738780af3794f0b97f) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Detect Expo projects independently of the single-valued `framework` hint. Project discovery now surfaces an `expoVersion` signal (the declared `expo` package spec, looked up in the project or any of its workspace packages, or `null`), paralleling `reactVersion`. The `expo` capability is keyed off `expoVersion !== null` rather than `framework === "expo"`, so Expo-specific rules now load on web-rooted monorepos whose `apps/mobile` workspace targets Expo, and on projects that declare both `expo` and a web bundler (where `vite` / `next` previously won framework detection and silently dropped the `expo` capability). The file-level package boundary in `oxlint-plugin-react-doctor` still keeps Expo-only rules quiet on web workspaces.

- [#615](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/615) [`8b313ba`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/8b313badda74de19ba56a242d965c54399d39b9c) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Fix two dead-code / fix-recipe papercuts surfaced on alias-heavy Next.js projects.

  **Dead-code no longer mis-flags `@/…` (and other) imports as unused.** The dead-code pass resolves imports through `oxc-resolver`, which returns realpath'd (symlink-free) paths, but built its module graph from the scan root as-is. When the project root sat behind a symlink — e.g. a macOS iCloud-synced `~/Documents` / `~/Desktop`, or a symlinked checkout — the two path spaces diverged, every import edge dropped, and files reachable only through those imports (in an alias-heavy codebase, every `@/…` target) were reported as "unused / unreachable". The scan root is now canonicalized before analysis so the module graph and the resolver agree. This was never specific to `@/*` aliases; relative imports were affected the same way.

  **Per-rule fix-recipe URLs are only shown when a recipe exists.** Findings advertised a "fetch the canonical fix recipe" URL (`/prompts/rules/<plugin>/<rule>.md`) for every diagnostic, but recipes are only published for react-doctor's own engine rules. Dead-code (`deslop/*`), the environment / supply-chain checks (`require-reduced-motion`, `require-pnpm-hardening`), and adopted third-party plugins (`eslint`, `unicorn`, `react-hooks-js`, …) have no recipe, so their links 404. The directive is now gated to engine rules, so agents are no longer sent to dead links.

- [#607](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/607) [`5dff3b5`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/5dff3b5a5da033e0ae4cd5dd432a74d36ca7d143) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Fix `react-doctor --staged` (and other scans) hanging after the diagnostics summary is already printed. When an adopted lint config crashed oxlint on the first attempt, the oxlint runner's per-batch progress timer was left running while the scan silently retried with `extends` stripped — so the run finished and printed results, but the orphaned `setInterval` kept the Node event loop alive and the process never returned control to the shell. The batch loop now clears the timer in a `finally`, so it's always cleaned up even when a batch throws. See [#599](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/599).

- [#614](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/614) [`daef23c`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/daef23ceff93634ffdb34c8e22e41610a07a596b) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - `jsx-key` no longer reports a missing key when a list element spreads the whole iteration item — `items.map((item) => <Item {...item} />)`. Spreading the row object is the canonical "this row carries its own identity" shape and was the dominant source of `jsx-key` noise on real lists, while rarely catching a genuine reorder bug. Genuine keyless lists still report: `items.map((item) => <Item name={item.name} />)`, index keys, array literals (`[<Item {...item} />]`), and spreads of anything other than the iteration variable.

- [#614](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/614) [`daef23c`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/daef23ceff93634ffdb34c8e22e41610a07a596b) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - App-only heuristics now stay quiet in published libraries, and React Compiler memoization-cleanup is demoted to a warning.

  - `react-hooks-js/static-components` and `no-render-prop-children` no longer fire on files in a published library — a non-`private` `package.json` that declares the publish contract (`name` + `exports`). They still fire in applications (including private monorepo apps that live under `packages/` or declare a niche internal `exports` map) and in any package without that contract, and an explicit per-rule severity in config always re-enables them.
  - `react-compiler-no-manual-memoization` now defaults to `warn` instead of `error` when React Compiler is detected — redundant `useMemo` / `useCallback` / `memo` is correctness-neutral cleanup, so it's hidden from the default report. The external `react-hooks-js/*` compiler rules stay `error` because each marks code the compiler could not optimize (a real perf regression).
  - New `buckets` config field: set `{ "buckets": { "compiler-cleanup": "error" } }` to re-enable strict errors for the redundant-memoization rule. A per-rule override still wins over a bucket.

- [#613](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/613) [`6448d5b`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/6448d5bfe1a920003a0d74d4080351d973dcbc0b) Thanks [@NisargIO](https://github.com/NisargIO)! - Speed up scans of effect-heavy codebases by memoizing `getDownstreamRefs` in the State & Effects rule helpers. `ascend()` re-descended the same large definition subtrees on every recursion step, so the seven effect rules (led by `no-pass-data-to-parent`) blew up superlinearly on big components with many `useEffect`s — re-walking and re-scoping identical bodies across recursion, across effects, and across rules. Caching the downstream-reference lookup per Program node (a `WeakMap` keyed on the per-`Program` analysis singleton, GC-bound with the file) collapses that to a single descent.

  On an 866-file Next.js app this cut ~9s (~24%) off a full scan — the worst rule on the largest file (a 1,159-line component with 10 effects) dropped from ~9.5s to ~0.18s, and the hot lint batch from ~13.5s to ~2.5s. Diagnostics are byte-identical (verified by a SHA-256 fingerprint over every diagnostic before/after); the cache only stores arrays callers already read and never mutate.

- [#616](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/616) [`bb15252`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/bb15252940bbd598846d7f7018df3fb86f11ea9f) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Add an `--experimental-parallel [workers]` flag that runs the oxlint lint pass across multiple worker processes instead of one batch at a time. React Doctor's rules are oxlint JS plugins (single-threaded per process), so a serial scan only ever pins one core; `--experimental-parallel` fans the file batches out across the requested number of concurrent oxlint subprocesses, which scales the scan nearly linearly with CPU cores (measured ~3.5–4.6x on a 1,500-file project and ~4.6x on Sentry's 8,773 files) while producing byte-identical diagnostics.

  `--experimental-parallel` with no value auto-detects available cores; `--experimental-parallel <n>` caps the worker count; `REACT_DOCTOR_PARALLEL=<n>` seeds the default for flag-less / CI runs. The worker count is clamped to a safe range to bound peak memory, and the default remains serial so resource usage stays opt-in.

- [#601](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/601) [`5f7cc7c`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/5f7cc7c36ed62b0c2264916f2aeb694e5713e821) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Publish a JSON Schema for `react-doctor.config.json` at `https://react.doctor/schema/config.json`.

  Pointing `$schema` at the URL enables editor autocomplete, hover docs from the interface JSDoc, and typo warnings in any editor that understands JSON Schema. Closes [#497](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/497).

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "https://react.doctor/schema/config.json",
    "lint": true
  }
  ```

  The schema is generated from `packages/core/src/types/config.ts` via `pnpm build:schema` and checked into `packages/website/public/schema/config.json`.

- [#606](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/606) [`fe01e57`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/fe01e573a91a36316c858ad1e7c12a5fe18c1039) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Redact secrets and PII from diagnostic output. Every diagnostic's `message`/`help` is now scrubbed for API keys, tokens, private keys, JWTs, credentialed URLs, and email addresses before it reaches the terminal, the JSON report, or the score API — so react-doctor never echoes or transmits a secret embedded in your source. Provider tokens keep their non-secret, type-identifying prefix (e.g. `sk_live_<redacted>`, `ghp_<redacted>`) so you can tell which credential leaked while the secret itself stays masked.

- [#625](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/625) [`bdb9e36`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/bdb9e36b0e8f27e04104f676bffd8c6091b65cc5) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Add 10 React Native & Expo diagnostics (researched against first-party docs/RFCs and validated against an OSS corpus). Six are oxlint AST rules; four are project-level checks gated on the React Native / Expo capability and run in the environment-checks phase (skipped in diff/staged mode).

  AST rules:

  - `rn-no-deep-imports` — deep imports of public symbols from `react-native/Libraries/*` (RFC 0894; breaks on upgrade). Curated to symbols re-exported from the root, with a tailored message for the relocated `NewAppScreen`; skips type-only imports and the Codegen/TurboModule authoring surface.
  - `rn-no-set-native-props` — `ref.current(?.).setNativeProps(...)`, a silent no-op under the New Architecture (Fabric).
  - `rn-no-image-children` — children inside react-native's `<Image>` (which renders none); use `<ImageBackground>`. Resolves the element to the `react-native` import so `expo-image`/custom `Image` are ignored.
  - `rn-no-panresponder` — `PanResponder` imported from `react-native` (JS-thread gestures); use `react-native-gesture-handler`.
  - `rn-detox-missing-await` — un-awaited Detox actions / `waitFor` / `expect(element(...))` in `*.e2e.*` files.
  - `expo-no-non-inlined-env` — computed `process.env[...]` and `process.env` destructuring, which `babel-preset-expo` can't inline (value is `undefined` at runtime); scoped to Expo client files.

  Project-level checks:

  - `rn-no-metro-babel-preset` — `module:metro-react-native-babel-preset` in a babel config (renamed to `@react-native/babel-preset`; uninstalled on RN 0.73+).
  - `rn-library-react-in-dependencies` — a `react-native-builder-bob` library listing `react`/`react-native` in `dependencies` instead of `peerDependencies` (duplicate-React / duplicate-native-module crashes).
  - `expo-reanimated-v4-requires-new-arch` — `react-native-reanimated` v4 with `newArchEnabled: false` in the app config (first-launch crash).
  - `expo-updates-no-unsafe-production-config` — `updates.disableAntiBrickingMeasures: true` in the app config (can brick installed apps).

- [#614](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/614) [`daef23c`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/daef23ceff93634ffdb34c8e22e41610a07a596b) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - `rn-no-raw-text` now auto-detects in-file custom text wrappers, cutting false positives on design-system `<Text>` forwarders. A component whose returned root is a `<Text>` — e.g. `const Banner = ({ children }) => <Text>{children}</Text>` or `export const Caption = (props) => <Text {...props} />` — is treated as a string-only text forwarder, so raw text passed to it (`<Banner>Hello</Banner>`) no longer reports. Mixed children still report (`<Banner><Icon /> hi</Banner>`) because a single-`<Text>` forwarder can't be trusted to route a JSX child into text. Components only referenced (not defined) in the file keep the existing name-heuristic behavior, and the config-driven `textComponents` / `rawTextWrapperComponents` overrides are unchanged.

- [#617](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/617) [`9777f1a`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/9777f1ac453d8211e90c66852e0527a0ec386bc6) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Configure React Doctor with `doctor.config.{ts,js,mjs,cjs,mts,cts,json}` (or a `package.json#reactDoctor` key), and add `react-doctor rules` commands to list, explain, and configure rules without hand-editing config.

  - **TS-first config.** Author `doctor.config.ts` (or any JS/JSON variant) — TypeScript and ESM configs load via `jiti`, and JSON configs allow comments and trailing commas (JSONC).
  - **`rules` commands.** `rules list` shows every rule and the severity it runs at; `rules explain <rule>` describes why a rule matters and how to tune it; and `rules set` / `enable` / `disable` / `category` / `ignore-tag` / `unignore-tag` edit your config for you. TS/JS configs are edited in place via `magicast` (formatting and comments preserved); JSON and `package.json` are edited as data; a `doctor.config.json` is created when no config exists. Rule references accept the full key (`react-doctor/no-danger`), the bare id (`no-danger`), or a legacy key (`react/no-danger`).
  - **`doctor-explain` skill** (alias `doctor-config`), shipped via `react-doctor install`, teaches coding agents to explain a rule before disabling it and to pick the narrowest control (rule severity vs category vs tag vs `surfaces`).

  **Breaking:** the config file is now `doctor.config.*` instead of `react-doctor.config.json`. The next time you run `react-doctor` interactively, an existing `react-doctor.config.json` is automatically migrated to a typed `doctor.config.ts` (settings preserved, `$schema` dropped) and you're told once — CI, coding-agent, `--staged`, JSON/score, and non-TTY runs are left untouched (a warning still nudges them). The `package.json#reactDoctor` key is unchanged.

- [#596](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/596) [`6e59f10`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/6e59f10ef8b2173f0c98a653b13702d84f6471e7) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Cleaner scan output and smarter file scoping:

  - The post-scan summary now leads with a "Top errors you should fix" block — each error shows a plain-language explanation and an inline code frame, with the rule's human title prefixed by its category (e.g. `Security: Use of eval()`) instead of its id, so it's clear at a glance what kind of problem it is.
  - Security rules now read as security findings: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (XSS) is categorized under Security, and security messages use explicit vulnerability language (code injection, XSS, reverse tabnabbing, CSRF, secret exposure).
  - Every rule's messages were rewritten to be short, plain, and dash-free, and each rule now carries a short `title`.
  - Generated bundler output (`*.iife.js`, `*.umd.js`, `*.global.js`, `*.min.js`) is now excluded from scans by default. As a result `project.sourceFileCount` (and the scanned-file totals) no longer count these generated bundles.
  - Minified files that carry an ordinary extension (e.g. a one-line `public/inject.js` bundle) are now detected by content and skipped, so they no longer flood the report with noise. Any diagnostic that still lands on an overlong single line falls back to a `file:line` reference instead of rendering an unreadable code frame.
  - Multi-project scans now report the number of UNIQUE files scanned, so nested workspace packages (a parent whose tree contains a child package) are no longer double-counted in the "Scanned N files" total.

- [#621](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/621) [`24425b1`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/24425b113adcd965545b8c790af85c13a0d86c86) Thanks [@NisargIO](https://github.com/NisargIO)! - Add Sentry crash reporting to the CLI. Uncaught errors that reach the CLI's error funnels are now captured via `@sentry/node` and flushed before the process exits, each enriched with a `run` context snapshot (version, node/platform/arch, the invocation `command`/`argv`, `cwd`, CI provider, coding agent, interactivity, and JSON mode) to make crashes triage-able. Sentry initializes as the first statement of the CLI entry so its global handlers are armed before any command runs, and it's scoped to the CLI only — the programmatic `@react-doctor/api` library never initializes Sentry.

  Reporting is opt-out: pass `--no-score` to disable crash reporting along with the hosted score API and share URL. The SDK is also skipped under test runs (`VITEST` / `NODE_ENV=test`).

- [#628](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/628) [`e9e71bb`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/e9e71bbc2f98e7175136918b1a3de134e9d7cb87) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Deepen the CLI's Sentry integration: uploaded source maps, unified tracing, and richer run context.

  - **Source maps**: the CLI bundle is now built with source maps, and the release pipeline injects Sentry Debug IDs into `dist/cli.js` and uploads the maps (`scripts/sentry-sourcemaps.mjs`, run from `pnpm release` and the `@dev` publish job) so crash stack traces are fully de-minified. Maps are uploaded to Sentry, not shipped in the npm tarball. Wired for both tagged releases and `@dev` snapshots; a no-op unless the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` / `SENTRY_ORG` / `SENTRY_PROJECT` CI secrets are configured.
  - **Tracing / OpenTelemetry**: each run is now a Sentry transaction, and the existing Effect instrumentation (`runInspect` plus every `Effect.fn("Service.method")` span) is bridged straight into Sentry as one unified per-run trace. If a user has their own OTLP backend configured (`REACT_DOCTOR_OTLP_*`), that still wins and the Effect trace is additionally parented under the Sentry trace so the two share a `trace_id`. Tracing is tunable via `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` (set to `0` to disable; default samples every run).
  - **Crash references**: when an error is reported, the Sentry event id is surfaced as a reference — printed in the CLI's error output ("Reference (mention this when reporting): …") and added to the prefilled GitHub issue — so a user-reported crash can be located in Sentry by id. Errors thrown during a scan are also linked back to that run's transaction trace (same `trace_id`) so the crash and its spans appear together.
  - **Environment / run information**: events now carry a Sentry `environment` (`production` / `development`, overridable via `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`), a `react-doctor@<version>` `release` that matches the uploaded source-map artifacts, and the full run snapshot as searchable tags on _every_ event (not just exceptions) — including which command ran (`command`, `argv`), where it ran (`origin` = cli/ci/agent/git-hook, plus `ci`/`ciProvider`), the launching package manager (`invokedVia`, e.g. npm vs. pnpm dlx), and Node major version.
  - **Project information**: the anonymous project shape we already detect during a scan is attached to crashes and the run transaction as soon as it's discovered — searchable `project.*` tags (framework, React major, TypeScript, React Compiler, Expo, React Native) plus a `project` context block (versions of React/Tailwind/Zod/Preact/Expo, TanStack Query, Reanimated, source-file count). The identifying `projectName`/`rootDirectory` are deliberately excluded; no source code or diagnostic findings are sent.
  - **Anonymized by default**: every event and transaction is scrubbed before it leaves the machine — `sendDefaultPii` is off (no IP), the hostname/`server_name`/device name and captured local variables are stripped, the OS username is removed from all paths (home directory → `~`) across cwd, argv, stack frames, and span attributes (e.g. the `inspect.directory` path), and known secrets/emails are masked via the same redactor used for diagnostics. If scrubbing ever fails, the event is dropped rather than sent.
  - **Configuration**: `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`, `SENTRY_RELEASE`, `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`, and `SENTRY_DEBUG` are all honored at runtime.

  Reporting remains opt-out and CLI-only: `--no-score` disables Sentry entirely (crash reporting and tracing), it's skipped under test runs, and the programmatic `@react-doctor/api` library never initializes Sentry.

- [#622](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/622) [`0938376`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/0938376e9c60dcc52fdf4691c15db49feb603033) Thanks [@NisargIO](https://github.com/NisargIO)! - Show `"warning"`-severity diagnostics by default again. A scan that reports only errors is too generous a bar for a health check, so warnings surface on every surface (CLI, PR comment, score, `--fail-on`) out of the box. Opt out with `--no-warnings` or `"warnings": false`; per-rule / per-category severity overrides still win as before.

- [#596](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/596) [`6e59f10`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/6e59f10ef8b2173f0c98a653b13702d84f6471e7) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Hide `warning`-severity diagnostics by default — a clean scan now reports only `error`-severity findings (errors always show). Opt warnings back in with the `--warnings` flag or `"warnings": true` config option; `--no-warnings` / `"warnings": false` is the explicit default-off. The toggle is the master switch and runs after per-rule / per-category severity overrides, so a rule explicitly set to `"warn"` via `rules` / `categories` still shows even when warnings are hidden.

  Because dead-code analysis only emits `warning`-severity findings, it's now skipped entirely when warnings are hidden (its results would be filtered out anyway) — avoiding an expensive analysis pass on the default path. `--warnings` / `"warnings": true` (and `--fail-on warning`) re-enable it.

The startup unref (added so one-shot non-interactive runs like `--json` from an eval runner holding the stdin pipe open can exit cleanly) was applied unconditionally, including on a real terminal. On a TTY `prompts` never re-refs the unref'd stdin handle — `readline.createInterface` + `setRawMode(true)` do not re-ref it — so the multiselect ("Select projects") rendered and the CLI then drained the event loop and exited (code 0) before the user could answer. Skipping the unref when stdin is a TTY keeps the one-shot exit fix for non-interactive pipes/sockets while leaving interactive terminals untouched. Adds an in-process behavioral test and a real-PTY CI smoke (`pnpm smoke:tty-prompt`).

Interactive prompts re-ref stdin via `readline` and never release it on close, undoing the startup `unrefStdin()` and holding the one-shot CLI's event loop open. The shared `prompts` wrapper now re-unrefs stdin once each prompt settles.

### Patch Changes

- [#570](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/570) [`d917f62`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/d917f62ed6215e9a984c9bfa83940bba723ff5de) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Add the `no-prop-types` architecture rule. React 19 removed runtime `propTypes` validation entirely — React no longer reads `Component.propTypes`, so invalid props that used to log a console warning now pass silently. The rule flags `Component.propTypes = { ... }` assignments and `static propTypes` class fields on component-cased identifiers, and is version-gated to React 19+ (`requires: ["react:19"]`) so projects where `propTypes` still runs stay quiet. It steers users toward TypeScript prop types plus explicit runtime validation. See [#460](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/460).

- [#582](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/582) [`b2934f9`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/b2934f93e439027ed132e40688d45ef682f05efb) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Fix a `rn-no-raw-text` false positive on fbtee translation tags. fbtee's `<fbt>` / `<fbs>` (and namespaced children like `<fbt:param>`) are compile-time translation tags that disappear at build time, so text inside `<Text><fbt>…</fbt></Text>` is really rendered inside `<Text>` and is safe on React Native. The rule now treats `fbt` / `fbs` as transparent wrappers when every ancestor up to a text-handling component is also transparent, while still reporting raw text when an `<fbt>` is used outside a `<Text>` boundary. See [#581](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/581).

- [#557](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/557) [`67848ae`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/67848aec9cba76fc44ec7e36ac3a2b0717f5bd28) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Scope React subproject discovery so running `react-doctor` from a home directory no longer reports unrelated, vendored projects as ambiguous candidates. When the scan root has no `package.json` or workspace manifest, the filesystem crawl now skips OS/editor app-data directories (`AppData`, `Library`, …) and stops descending past a fixed depth. Previously a home-directory scan could surface React packages bundled inside editor installs (e.g. a VS Code extension under `AppData`) alongside real projects, aborting with `Multiple React projects found`. See [#545](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/545).

- [#576](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/576) [`e7a998a`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/e7a998a9fa00a894177d9afc22e3a78b814392f1) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Unref `process.stdin` at CLI startup so an inherited stdin pipe/socket can no longer keep the event loop alive after a scan completes. Previously `react-doctor --json` (and other one-shot runs) could finish the scan and flush the full report yet never exit when launched by a parent that holds the stdin write-end open (eval runners, CI harnesses, editor integrations) — Node kept the loop alive on the idle `Socket fd=0`. Interactive prompts are unaffected because `prompts`' `readline` interface re-refs stdin on demand.

  - oxlint-plugin-react-doctor@0.2.11

## 0.2.10

### Patch Changes

- Add Preact project detection so `react-doctor inspect` recognizes Preact workspaces, including Vite + Preact projects that still report `vite` as their framework, and enables the bundled Preact rule family.

- Bundle new diagnostics across the rule set: Preact compatibility checks, HTML correctness and dialog accessibility rules, `hooks-no-nan-in-deps`, Jotai atom diagnostics, React Native performance rules, `js-async-reduce-without-awaited-acc`, and React 19.2 `<Activity>` effect-boundary checks.

- Fix CLI reliability around dead-code scans and setup prompts. Dead-code analysis now runs with a bounded worker path instead of freezing the scan, monorepo scans still show the setup prompt, and repeated setup questions collapse into one install flow.

- Inherit false-positive fixes for `control-has-associated-label` and `no-giant-component`.

- Dependency bump: `oxlint-plugin-react-doctor@0.2.10`.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- **Animated score progress bar.** The CLI health score now renders with a smooth progress-bar animation, automatically skipped in CI and coding-agent environments.

- **CI and agent detection.** New `isCiOrAgent` utility detects CI providers and coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, etc.) and suppresses interactive prompts, animations, and the onboarding flow so scans run non-interactively where appropriate.

- **Concurrent lint + dead-code analysis.** The `inspect` command now runs linting and dead-code detection in parallel instead of sequentially, reducing wall-clock scan time.

- **Agent install hint.** When running inside a coding agent, the CLI suggests `react-doctor install` to set up the agent skill for in-editor diagnostics.

- **Skip prefilled project question.** The monorepo project-selection prompt is skipped when there is only one scannable project, removing an unnecessary interactive step.

- **`/doctor` triage skill.** The React Doctor agent skill now includes a `/doctor` command that fetches the canonical playbook for full-project triage.

- Bundle `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` as a direct dependency so React Compiler rules work out of the box.

- **Node 20 support.** Fix runtime dependency resolution so the CLI runs correctly on Node 20 without requiring Node 22+ built-ins.

- Cover child workspace diff include paths so `--diff` mode in monorepos correctly scans files changed inside nested workspace packages.

- Stop `jsx-key` from flagging shorthand JSX fragments (`<>...</>`) which cannot accept a `key` prop.

- Normalize static template literal handling so rules treat `` `hello` `` the same as `"hello"`.

- Add `require-pnpm-hardening` environment check that warns when `pnpm` is detected without strict lockfile settings.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- **Effect v4 runtime migration.** The entire scan pipeline is rebuilt on Effect v4 - tagged errors, dependency-injected services, generator-based control flow, and `Context.Reference` ambient config replace the previous imperative architecture.

- **New `@react-doctor/api` package.** Programmatic `diagnose()` entry point backed by the same `runInspect` orchestrator the CLI uses, with typed `ReactDoctorError` failures and `Effect.catchReasons` dispatch.

- **`inspect()` rewired through `runInspect`.** The CLI `inspect` command now delegates to the core streaming orchestrator instead of managing the scan loop directly, aligning CLI and API behavior.

- **Native agent hook installer.** `react-doctor install` writes post-checkout / post-merge git hooks that auto-run the scan on relevant file changes.

- **Opt-in OpenTelemetry.** `REACT_DOCTOR_OTLP_ENDPOINT` + `REACT_DOCTOR_OTLP_AUTH_HEADER` ship every service span to an OTLP backend.

- **User-plugin extension.** `config.plugins: [...]` loads custom oxlint plugin packages alongside the built-in rules.

- **Security hardening.** Pin CI workflow permissions, add fork guards, fix four pre-existing audit findings.

- Collapse `@react-doctor/types` and `@react-doctor/project-info` into `@react-doctor/core`.

- Adopt `Effect.Console` throughout - drop the custom `Logger` service.

- Restore `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` as a hard dependency so React Compiler rules resolve without requiring users to install the peer separately.

- [#273](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/273) [`47772b7`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/47772b7da4f6e412b09e3a4f74d888307faf74a1) - Natively port the 8 rules from `eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect`
  (NickvanDyke, MIT) into `oxlint-plugin-react-doctor`. They now ship as
  `react-doctor/*` rules and no longer require the optional peer
  dependency. The optional peer-dep surface (`effect/*` rules,
  `resolveYouMightNotNeedEffectPlugin`,
  `YOU_MIGHT_NOT_NEED_EFFECT_NAMESPACE`) is removed from
  `@react-doctor/core`.

  The ports use a real `eslint-scope` ScopeManager (cached per Program
  via `WeakMap`) - same `references` / `resolved.defs[].node.init` /
  `isEventualCallTo` chasing the upstream plugin uses. Diagnostic
  messages match upstream verbatim with template variables substituted
  in JS.

  | Rule (now `react-doctor/<id>`)      | What it catches                                                          |
  | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | `no-derived-state`                  | Storing derived state via a useEffect instead of computing during render |
  | `no-chain-state-updates`            | Chaining state updates across effects                                    |
  | `no-event-handler`                  | Using state + a guarded effect as an event handler                       |
  | `no-adjust-state-on-prop-change`    | Adjusting state in an effect when a prop changes                         |
  | `no-reset-all-state-on-prop-change` | Resetting all state in an effect (use a `key` prop)                      |
  | `no-pass-live-state-to-parent`      | Pushing live state to a parent via a callback in an effect               |
  | `no-pass-data-to-parent`            | Passing fetched data to a parent via a callback in an effect             |
  | `no-initialize-state`               | Initializing state inside a mount-only effect                            |

  Parity coverage: 195 of 196 upstream test cases pass (the 1 remaining
  case is upstream's own `todo: true`, "Set derived state via identical
  intermediate setter").

  These coexist with React Doctor's existing thematically-related rules
  (`no-derived-state-effect`, `no-effect-chain`, `no-event-trigger-state`,
  `no-prop-callback-in-effect`) - different IDs, different shapes,
  different messages.

### Minor Changes

- [`5be2ead`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/5be2eadd90b2248b28b228fad306808cec1bf758) - Add configuration-level controls for React Doctor's rule output. Users can now set top-level `rules` and `categories` severity overrides, tune individual output surfaces (`cli`, `prComment`, `score`, and `ciFailure`) by tag/category/rule id, and rely on registered rule-family tags such as `design`, `react-native`, `server-action`, `test-noise`, and `migration-hint` for broad filtering.

  The scan pipeline now applies those controls both when generating the oxlint config and when post-processing diagnostics, so `"off"` can skip rules before they run while `"warn"` / `"error"` restamp emitted diagnostics consistently across the CLI, score, PR comments, and CI failure gate. The oxlint plugin also exposes shared rule-set maps that the ESLint plugin reuses for its flat configs.

  Expose the GitHub Action's `annotations` input so workflow users can opt into inline PR annotations without dropping down to the raw CLI.

- [`809e38c`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/809e38cebabc15c42b3c40ee8c7a753c3d7549d0) - Extract project / dependency / framework detection, the oxlint runner +
  scoring engine, and the shared TypeScript type layer out of the
  `react-doctor` monolith into three new public workspace packages:
  `@react-doctor/types`, `@react-doctor/project-info`, and
  `@react-doctor/core` ([#249](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/249)). The oxlint plugin is restructured into
  per-rule modules under `src/plugin/rules/<category>/<rule>.ts` with a
  codegen'd `rule-registry.ts` ([#218](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/218), [#228](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/228), [#230](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/230), [#231](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/231), [#234](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/234), [#235](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/235), [#236](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/236),
  [#242](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/242)). Land the user-feedback sweep ([#208](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/208)): scoring transparency hooks,
  per-rule severity + rule-set selection config options, and reduced
  false positives across the design / Tailwind / state-and-effects rule
  families. Reorganise the CLI into `cli/commands/` + `cli/utils/`
  ([#250](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/250)), and forward `reactMajorVersion` through programmatic
  `diagnose()` ([#174](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/174)).

### Patch Changes

- [`29b7229`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/29b7229ea144cfe80c4401391eed3aa035071bcd) - Add `oxlint-plugin-react-doctor` to `dependencies` so it is installed
  alongside the CLI. The bundler correctly externalises the plugin (oxlint
  loads it by file path at runtime) but it was missing from the published
  dependency list, causing `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on `npx react-doctor`.

- [`99f6a6a`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/99f6a6ad1cc41828172b26f17a84bcf2d66ff17c) - Rule-fix wave for the 0.2.0-beta.5 release:

  - Scope `no-secrets-in-client-code` to client-reachable bindings -
    skips server-only modules, public env-prefixed values, and
    locally-classified safe files ([#252](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/252)).
  - `nextjs-no-side-effect-in-get-handler` stops flagging
    `response.headers.set(...)` and locally-constructed `Map` / `Set` /
    `Headers` inside GET handlers; the same safe-bindings classifier
    benefits `server-auth-actions` and the TanStack Start
    `get-mutation` rule ([#260](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/260)).
  - `async-defer-await` no longer reports awaits inside destructured
    patterns with defaults, bare-statement early-returns, or awaits
    guarded by an earlier `if … return …` ([#265](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/265)).
  - `js-length-check-first` detects length guards anywhere earlier in
    an `&&` chain, not only as the immediate left operand ([#269](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/269)).
  - `async-parallel` is suppressed in test files, browser-fixture /
    Playwright helpers, and ordered UI flows where serial awaits are
    deliberate ([#270](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/270)).
  - `js-combine-iterations` skips lazy `Iterator` helper chains
    (`Iterator.from`, `Iterator.prototype.{map,filter,take,drop,…}`)
    whose evaluation semantics differ from `Array.prototype` ([#272](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/272),
    resolves [#205](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/205)).
  - `no-prevent-default` is framework-aware: Remix / Next.js
    progressive-enhancement form handlers, synthetic event types with
    no documented alternative, and form `onSubmit` handlers that
    subsequently call `fetch` / a server action no longer trip ([#274](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/274)).
  - New per-surface diagnostic controls in `@react-doctor/core` +
    `react-doctor`: design and Tailwind cleanup categories are demoted
    from the default PR-comment surface while staying visible in the
    CLI report and at the CI failure gate ([#271](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/271)).

- [`10d5de8`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/10d5de804fe9c03fa9f18e5350bb26965a5108ac) - Fix workspace packages not being bundled into dist, causing
  `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package '@react-doctor/core'`
  when running the published CLI.

- [#284](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/284) [`b34c5c4`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/b34c5c4db28539d9407fc08600e0e8c28dea67cd) - Harden glob pattern compilation against ReDoS:

  - Replace the hand-rolled glob-to-regex compiler with [`picomatch`](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), the proven matcher behind `chokidar`, `fast-glob`, and `micromatch`. The previous compiler turned patterns like `**/**/**/**/**/foo.tsx` into nested optional `(?:.+/)?` groups whose backtracking is exponential in the number of `**` segments - a 20-deep pattern hung for over 30 seconds on a 60-character non-matching input.
  - Reject obviously pathological patterns early with a clear `InvalidGlobPatternError` carrying the offending pattern and a human-readable reason, instead of crashing the scan. Limits live in `@react-doctor/core/constants` (`MAX_GLOB_PATTERN_LENGTH_CHARS = 1024`, `MAX_GLOB_PATTERN_WILDCARD_COUNT = 24`) and bound worst-case work regardless of the underlying engine. Real-world ignore patterns like `**/foo/**/bar/**/*.tsx` sit well under the cap.
  - Surface invalid `ignore.files` and `ignore.overrides[*].files` entries as `[react-doctor] …` warnings on stderr and skip just the bad pattern, so a single typo no longer takes the whole scan down.
  - Add regression tests covering the worst-case patterns (deeply-stacked globstars and dense `a*a*a*…` alternations) and the validation surface.

- [#266](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/266) [`529015d`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/529015d1d89441c4708f49413ecd540db7c04255) - Scope React Native rules to per-package boundaries. Previously every
  `rn-*` rule fired on every file in a project whose top-level framework
  was detected as React Native or Expo - even on sibling workspaces that
  were clearly web targets. In a mixed RN + web monorepo (`apps/mobile`
  alongside `apps/web` and `packages/storybook`) the rules would noisily
  report issues against Next.js, Vite, Docusaurus, Storybook, and plain
  React DOM packages where they don't apply.

  React Native rules now walk up to the file's nearest `package.json`
  before running. The rule body is skipped when the package declares a
  web-only framework (`next`, `vite`, `react-scripts`, `gatsby`,
  `@remix-run/react`, `@docusaurus/core`, `@storybook/*`, or plain
  `react-dom` without an RN sibling) and stays active when the package
  declares `react-native`, `expo`, `react-native-tvos`, `react-native-windows`,
  `react-native-macos`, anything under the `@react-native/` or
  `@react-native-` community namespaces (`@react-native-firebase/*`,
  `@react-native-async-storage/*`, `@react-native-community/*`, …), or
  Metro's top-level `"react-native"` resolution field.

  The detection is bidirectional: a web-rooted monorepo (root
  `package.json` declares `next` or `vite`) still loads `rn-*` rules
  when any workspace targets React Native or Expo, so the rules now
  fire on `apps/mobile` of a `next`-rooted repo as well as the inverse
  layout that the file-level boundary alone covered.

  `rn-no-raw-text` additionally skips raw text inside `Platform.OS === "web"`
  branches: `if`, `?:`, and `&&` / `||` short-circuits, the mirror
  `Platform.OS !== "web"` else branches, `switch (Platform.OS) { case "web": … }`
  case bodies, and the `web` arm of `Platform.select({ web: …, default: … })`.
  Optional chaining (`Platform?.OS`) and the TS non-null assertion
  (`Platform.OS!`) parse the same way as the bare form. The walker stops
  at function and `Program` boundaries so JSX defined inside a callback
  hoisted out of a `Platform.OS` branch does not inherit the parent
  guard.

  Native-only file extensions (`.ios.tsx`, `.android.tsx`, `.native.tsx`)
  keep the rule active even when the surrounding package classification
  is ambiguous.

- [`99f6a6a`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/99f6a6ad1cc41828172b26f17a84bcf2d66ff17c) - False-positive sweep across the rule plugin and the oxlint runner:

  - Gate React-19-only rules on the detected React major version so they
    stay silent on React 18 projects, with hardened catalog / peer-range /
    workspace traversal in `@react-doctor/project-info` ([#254](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/254)).
  - Treat early-return guards as render-reachable state reads so
    `rerender-state-only-in-handlers` / `no-event-trigger-state` stop
    recommending `useRef` for state that gates render output ([#255](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/255)).
  - Narrow `no-effect-event-handler` - DOM imperatives, prop callbacks
    invoked from effects, and side effects routed through a stable ref
    are no longer reclassified as handler-only ([#256](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/256)).
  - Suppress rules-of-hooks diagnostics on locally-defined `useX`
    helpers that are not React hooks, and add the `no-em-dash-in-jsx-text`
    / `no-three-period-ellipsis` typography rules ([#257](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/257)).
  - Collapse duplicate oxlint diagnostics and recover diagnostics from
    large monorepo projects via batched runs + a new
    `dedupe-diagnostics` helper in `@react-doctor/core` ([#262](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/262)).

- [#202](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/202) [`53fa4df`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/53fa4dffe837e0157fb850fef700fccaaec191ea) - Detect the project's Tailwind version (`tailwindcss` in `package.json`,
  including pnpm and Bun catalog references) and gate Tailwind-aware
  rules on it. `design-no-redundant-size-axes` (which suggests collapsing
  `w-N h-N` → `size-N`) now stays silent on Tailwind v3.0 … v3.3 - those
  versions predate the `size-N` shorthand and the suggestion would
  generate classes that don't compile. The rule still fires on Tailwind
  v3.4+, v4+, and when the Tailwind version cannot be resolved.

  A new `tailwindVersion` field is added to `ProjectInfo` and printed
  during scans so it's visible alongside the detected React version and
  framework.

- Updated dependencies [[`99f6a6a`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/99f6a6ad1cc41828172b26f17a84bcf2d66ff17c), [`529015d`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/529015d1d89441c4708f49413ecd540db7c04255), [`5be2ead`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/5be2eadd90b2248b28b228fad306808cec1bf758), [`99f6a6a`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/99f6a6ad1cc41828172b26f17a84bcf2d66ff17c), [`809e38c`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/809e38cebabc15c42b3c40ee8c7a753c3d7549d0)]:

  and `react-doctor install` binaries are surface-compatible with
  0.1.6.

- [#250](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/250) [`6e2ee9d`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/6e2ee9d474fddbde4c1246ff65b2f3e5bb3a42fc) - **CLI reorganised.** `src/cli/` is now split into `commands/` +
  `utils/`, mirroring the layout ported from `react-grab`. Each
  subcommand has a dedicated module (`inspect`, `install`, version /
  help). No user-visible change to flags or output.

- [#208](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/208) [`8556b31`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/8556b31d8e4e165f791db0aa60a6b038b18ec777) - **User-feedback sweep.** Reduce false positives across the design /
  Tailwind / state-and-effects rule groups, surface per-rule scoring
  contributions in `react-doctor inspect`, and add `--severity` /
  `--rule-set` CLI options plus their `react-doctor.config.json`
  counterparts. Closes the bulk of the feedback collected on 0.1.x.

- [#174](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/174) - Forward
  `reactMajorVersion` through the programmatic `diagnose()` entry
  point so embedders running react-doctor inside their own pipeline
  (Vercel AI Code Review sandbox and friends) get the same React-19
  rule gating the CLI gets.

- [#202](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/202) [`53fa4df`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/53fa4dffe837e0157fb850fef700fccaaec191ea) - Detect the project's Tailwind version (`tailwindcss` in `package.json`,
  including pnpm and Bun catalog references) and gate Tailwind-aware
  rules on it. `design-no-redundant-size-axes` (which suggests collapsing
  `w-N h-N` → `size-N`) now stays silent on Tailwind v3.0 … v3.3 - those
  versions predate the `size-N` shorthand and the suggestion would
  generate classes that don't compile. The rule still fires on Tailwind
  v3.4+, v4+, and when the Tailwind version cannot be resolved.

  A new `tailwindVersion` field is added to `ProjectInfo` and printed
  during scans so it's visible alongside the detected React version and
  framework.

### Patch Changes

- [`e9e4217`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/e9e4217711341cf2bfb7c1b11f37caaae44df7c3) - Harden `discover-project` and `resolve-diagnose-target`: tighter
  workspace-root detection constants, additional regression coverage in
  `tests/diagnose.test.ts` and `tests/discover-project.test.ts` for the
  nested-subproject fallback added in 0.1.5.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- [`b06b768`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/b06b768) ([#193](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/193)) - `diagnose()` now falls back to the first nested React subproject when the
  requested directory has no root `package.json`, instead of crashing with
  `No package.json found in <directory>`. This unblocks external review
  runners (e.g. the Vercel AI Code Review sandbox) that point `diagnose()`
  at the cloned repo root for projects whose `package.json` lives in a
  subfolder like `apps/web`. When neither the root nor any nested
  subdirectory contains a React project, `diagnose()` now throws a clearer
  `No React project found in <directory>` error.

- [#200](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/200) - Typed
  errors from `diagnose()` plus a `rootDir` config option so embedders
  can target a specific subdirectory without relying on cwd inference.

- [#201](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/201) - Integrate
  `eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect` into the curated
  rule set so its useEffect-elimination diagnostics flow into the score
  alongside react-doctor's own state-and-effects rules.

- [#194](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/194) - Resolve
  the React version from Bun grouped catalogs (in addition to pnpm
  catalogs) so monorepos using Bun for dependency hoisting still get an
  accurate React major back from the catalog resolver.

- [#196](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/196) - Match
  `react-doctor-disable*` suppression comments that carry descriptive
  trailing text (e.g. `// react-doctor-disable-next-line rule -- why`)
  instead of requiring a bare comment. Resolves
  [#159](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/159).

- [#198](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/198) - Expose
  `--why` as a documented public alias for `--explain` in the CLI.
  Resolves [#161](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/161).

- [#195](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/195) - The
  GitHub Action's score step is output-only and never fails the job, so
  consumers can gate on the score themselves without losing the run.
  Resolves [#190](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/190).

- [#197](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/197) - Docs:

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- [`a63d5d5`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/a63d5d5d0bbff26e7367a0b6d634aeb089a935ef) - CLI scan output reformat. Adds `utils/wrap-indented-text.ts` for
  consistent wrapping of multi-line diagnostic recommendations, expands
  the scan-summary types to carry per-line wrap state, and threads the
  helper through `scan.ts`. Backed by the new `wrap-indented-text.test.ts`
  unit suite and a `cli-and-output` regression suite that snapshots the
  rendered CLI output.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [#184](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/184) - Add a
  `rawTextWrapperComponents` config option so projects can teach
  `rn-no-raw-text` about their own `<Text>` wrappers (e.g. design-system
  primitives that render `Text` internally). Resolves
  [#183](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/183).

- [#182](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/182) - Restore
  React Compiler rules to `error` severity. They had silently regressed
  to `warn` in 0.1.0 when the plugin-resolution gating landed, masking
  Compiler-blocking violations behind the warning lane.

- [#181](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/181) - Website
  fix: keep the diagnostic count next to the rule name on narrow widths
  in the leaderboard / diagnostic listings.

- [`cca5808`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/cca5808) - Promote `react-hooks-js/*` diagnostics to errors so projects with
  React Hooks rule violations no longer pass with a clean score.

- [`9ee3a6d`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/9ee3a6d) - Refresh the website's terminal demo to match the new CLI output
  format introduced in 0.1.1 / 0.1.4.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [`6ddb02c`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/6ddb02c6b08fbfb06e2429d3cabd338c91891cd6) - Polish follow-up to the 0.1.1 CLI redesign. Consolidates duplicated
  scan-summary literals into `constants.ts`, simplifies `scan.ts` to
  drop a redundant branch (-9 LOC), and tightens the `spinner.ts`
  helper so its cleanup is symmetric with start. No user-visible
  behaviour change.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#178](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/178) - CLI
  scan-summary redesign. The final report now inlines a category
  breakdown (state-and-effects / design / bundle-size / …) and a
  compact rule list grouped under each category, replacing the
  previous single-line counts. Verbose mode keeps the per-diagnostic
  listing.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d71a6bf: feat(react-doctor): ship rules as an ESLint plugin (`react-doctor/eslint-plugin`)

  The same React Doctor rule set that powers the CLI scan and the
  `react-doctor/oxlint-plugin` export is now available as a first-class
  ESLint plugin. Drop it into your `eslint.config.js` flat config and
  diagnostics surface inline through whichever IDE / agent / pre-commit
  hook already speaks ESLint - no separate `react-doctor` invocation
  needed.

  ```js
  // eslint.config.js
  import reactDoctor from "react-doctor/eslint-plugin";

  export default [
    reactDoctor.configs.recommended,
    reactDoctor.configs.next, // composable framework presets
    reactDoctor.configs["react-native"],
    reactDoctor.configs["tanstack-start"],
    reactDoctor.configs["tanstack-query"],
    // reactDoctor.configs.all, // every rule at react-doctor's default severity
  ];
  ```

  The exported `recommended`, `next`, `react-native`, `tanstack-start`,
  `tanstack-query`, and `all` configs reuse the exact severity maps the
  react-doctor CLI emits to oxlint, so behavior stays in lock-step
  between engines. You can also cherry-pick individual rules under the
  `react-doctor/*` namespace.

  The visitor signatures inside each rule are already ESLint-compatible
  (`create(context) => visitors`); the new export wraps each rule with
  the ESLint-required `meta` (`type`, `docs.url`, `schema`) and exposes
  the plugin shape ESLint v9 flat configs expect. Closes
  [#143](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/143).

- d71a6bf: feat(react-doctor): adopt the project's existing oxlint / eslint config and factor those rules into the score

  When a project has a JSON-format oxlint or eslint config (`.oxlintrc.json`
  or `.eslintrc.json`) at the scanned directory or any ancestor up to the
  nearest project boundary (`.git` directory or monorepo root),
  react-doctor now folds that config into the same scan via oxlint's
  `extends` field. The user's existing rules fire alongside the curated
  react-doctor rule set, and the resulting diagnostics count toward the
  0–100 health score - no separate `oxlint` / `eslint` invocation needed.

  **Behavior change on upgrade.** Projects with an existing
  `.oxlintrc.json` / `.eslintrc.json` will see new diagnostics flow into
  the score on first run; the score may drop. Set
  `"adoptExistingLintConfig": false` in `react-doctor.config.json` (or the
  `"reactDoctor"` key in `package.json`) to preserve the previous
  behavior. `customRulesOnly: true` also implies opt-out, since that mode
  runs only the `react-doctor/*` plugin.

  **Resilience.** If oxlint can't load the user's config (broken JSON,
  missing plugin, unknown rule name), react-doctor logs the reason on
  stderr and retries the scan once without `extends` so the score is
  still computed off the curated rule set instead of failing the whole
  lint pass.

  **Coverage broadened.** Diagnostics on `.ts` and `.js` files are now
  reported (previously the parser dropped everything that wasn't `.tsx`
  / `.jsx`). This affects react-doctor's own JS-performance / bundle-size
  rules in addition to adopted user rules.

  **Limitations.** Only JSON configs are picked up: oxlint's `extends`
  cannot evaluate JS or TS, so flat configs (`eslint.config.js`),
  `.eslintrc.{js,cjs}`, and `oxlint.config.ts` are silently skipped.
  Rule-level severities (`"rules": {...}`) flow through, but
  category-level enables (`"categories": {...}`) do not - react-doctor's
  local categories block always wins. Closes #143.

- d71a6bf: feat(react-doctor): add 11 new lint rules - 3 state / correctness, 8 design system

  **3 new state / correctness rules** (all `warn`):

  - `react-doctor/no-direct-state-mutation` - flags `state.foo = x` and
    in-place array mutators (`push` / `pop` / `shift` / `unshift` /
    `splice` / `sort` / `reverse` / `fill` / `copyWithin`) on `useState`
    values. Tracks shadowed names through nested function params and
    locals so a handler that re-binds the state name doesn't
    false-positive.
  - `react-doctor/no-set-state-in-render` - flags only **unconditional**
    top-level setter calls so the canonical
    `if (prev !== prop) setPrev(prop)` derive-from-props pattern stays
    clean.
  - `react-doctor/no-uncontrolled-input` - catches `<input value={…}>`
    without `onChange` / `readOnly`, `value` + `defaultValue` conflicts,
    and `useState()` flip-from-undefined. Bails on JSX spread props
    (`{...register(…)}`, Headless UI, Radix) where `onChange` may come
    from spread.

  **8 new design-system rules in `react-ui.ts`** (all `warn`):

  - `react-doctor/design-no-bold-heading` -
    `font-bold` / `font-extrabold` / `font-black` or inline
    `fontWeight ≥ 700` on `h1`–`h6`.
  - `react-doctor/design-no-redundant-padding-axes` - collapse
    `px-N py-N` → `p-N`.
  - `react-doctor/design-no-redundant-size-axes` - collapse `w-N h-N` →
    `size-N`.
  - `react-doctor/design-no-space-on-flex-children` - use `gap-*` over
    `space-*-*`.
  - `react-doctor/design-no-em-dash-in-jsx-text` - em dashes in JSX
    text.
  - `react-doctor/design-no-three-period-ellipsis` - `Loading...` →
    `Loading…`.
  - `react-doctor/design-no-default-tailwind-palette` -
    `indigo-*` / `gray-*` / `slate-*` reads as the Tailwind template
    default; reports every offending token in the className (not just
    the first).
  - `react-doctor/design-no-vague-button-label` - `OK` / `Continue` /
    `Submit` etc.; recurses into `<>…</>` fragment children.

  Each new rule has dedicated regression tests covering both the
  positive trigger and the false-positive cases above.

  **Other**

  - Hoists shared regex / token patterns into the appropriate
    `constants.ts` per AGENTS.md.

- d71a6bf: remove(react-doctor): drop browser entrypoints, browser CLI, and the
  `react-doctor-browser` workspace package

  **Removed package exports.** `react-doctor/browser` and
  `react-doctor/worker` are no longer published. Imports of either subpath
  will fail with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. If you depended on the
  in-browser diagnostics pipeline (caller-supplied `projectFiles` map +
  `runOxlint` callback running oxlint in a Web Worker), pin
  `react-doctor@0.0.47` or vendor the relevant modules from the
  `archive/browser` git branch.

  **Removed CLI subcommand.** `react-doctor browser …` (`start`, `stop`,
  `status`, `snapshot`, `screenshot`, `playwright`) is gone. The
  long-running headless Chrome session, ARIA snapshot helpers, screenshot
  capture, and `--eval` Playwright harness are no longer available from
  the CLI.

  **Removed companion package.** The `react-doctor-browser` npm package
  (headless browser automation, CDP discovery, system Chrome launcher,
  cross-browser cookie extraction) has been removed from the workspace.
  The last published version remains installable on npm but will not
  receive further updates.

  **Why.** The browser surface area was unused inside the monorepo (the
  website does not import it) and added a heavy dependency footprint
  (`playwright`, `libsql`, etc.) for a public API with no known internal
  consumers. Removing it tightens what `react-doctor` is responsible for:
  the diagnostics CLI, the Node `react-doctor/api`, and the
  `react-doctor/eslint-plugin` / `react-doctor/oxlint-plugin` exports.

  The full removed source remains available on the `archive/browser`
  branch for anyone who wants to fork or vendor the modules.

### Patch Changes

- 2aebfa6: fix(react-doctor): support block comment forms of `react-doctor-disable-line` / `react-doctor-disable-next-line`

  The inline-suppression matcher previously only recognized line comments
  (`// react-doctor-disable-…`). Block comments - including the JSX form
  `{/* react-doctor-disable-next-line … */}`, which is the only suppression
  form legal directly inside JSX - were silently ignored, forcing users to
  write `{/* // react-doctor-disable-line … */}` as a workaround. Both forms
  now work, and either accepts a comma- or whitespace-separated rule list
  or no rule id (suppress every diagnostic on the targeted line). Closes #144.

- 2aebfa6: fix(react-doctor): stop flagging `useState` as `useRef` when state reaches render through `useMemo`, derived values, or context `value`

  `rerender-state-only-in-handlers` (the rule that suggests "use `useRef`
  because this state is never read in render") only checked whether the
  state name appeared by name in the component's `return` JSX. That
  heuristic produced loud false positives for ordinary patterns:

  - state filtered/derived through `useMemo` → JSX uses the memo result
  - state passed as the `value` of a React Context Provider
  - state combined with other variables into a rendered constant

  Following the bad hint and converting these to `useRef` silently broke
  apps because `ref.current = …` does not trigger a re-render - search
  results stopped updating, dialogs stayed open, and context consumers
  saw stale snapshots.

  The rule now performs a transitive "render-reachable" analysis on
  top-level component bindings. A `useState` is only flagged when neither
  the value itself nor anything derived from it (recursively) appears
  anywhere in the rendered JSX, including attribute values like
  `<Context value={…}>`, `style={…}`, `className={…}`, etc. Truly
  transient state (e.g. a scroll position only stored to be ignored)
  still fires. Closes #146.

- [#148](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/148) ([`3f5c031`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/3f5c031)) - Add the (now-removed in 0.1.0) `react-doctor browser` CLI subcommand
  and 11 new lint rules: 3 state / correctness rules
  (`no-direct-state-mutation`, `no-set-state-in-render`,
  `no-uncontrolled-input`) and 8 design-system rules (see the
  dedicated bullet above).

- [#152](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/152) ([`8f10098`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/8f10098)) - 4 new React 18→19 migration rules: pre-flight checks for the
  `forwardRef`-deprecation / new context API / new ref-callback
  cleanup / `use()` adoption migration paths.

- [#154](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/154) ([`276ea2f`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/276ea2f)) - Add `prefer-use-sync-external-store` rule. Catches `useEffect`-based
  subscriptions that should be `useSyncExternalStore` (concurrent-mode
  safe, tearing-resistant).

- [#155](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/155) ([`2240b1f`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/2240b1f)) - Add `no-event-trigger-state` rule. Flags state that is only ever
  written from an event handler and only read from the rendered JSX
  return - a frequent prop-derivation antipattern.

- [#156](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/156) ([`4b92f50`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/4b92f50)) - Add `no-effect-chain` rule. Flags `useEffect` chains where one
  effect's setState triggers another effect, which is almost always a
  signal to collapse the chain into a derived value or event handler.

- [#157](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/157) ([`0be99ad`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/0be99ad)) - Comprehensive useEffect analyzer: three new rules
  (`no-mutable-in-deps`, `no-mirror-prop-effect`, `effect-needs-cleanup`)
  plus shared dependency-tracking infrastructure.

- [#162](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/162) ([`945138d`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/945138d)) - Gate `prefer-use-effect-event` behind React 19+ so the suggestion
  doesn't fire on React 18 projects (where `useEffectEvent` is not
  available).

- [#163](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/163) ([`c20857e`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/c20857e)) - `no-effect-event-handler` honors empty-frame barriers in prop-stack
  lookups so callbacks hoisted out of effects don't inherit the
  surrounding effect classification.

- [#165](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/165) ([`78db3b2`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/78db3b2)) - Multi-line JSX and stacked suppression comments, per-file rule
  overrides, and near-miss hints for misspelled rule ids.

- [#166](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/166) ([`8745c34`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/8745c34)) - Suppression follow-ups: audit-mode handling, overrides-config
  validation, `--explain` working inside monorepos, JSX generics
  parsing, line-comment skip semantics, and a single-pass evaluator
  for the suppression matcher.

- [#167](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/167) ([`d3e26d6`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/d3e26d6)) - Refactor: consolidate state-and-effects rule plumbing.

- [#169](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/169) ([`50d08fd`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/50d08fd)) - AGENTS.md compliance pass on the state-and-effects rule directory.

- [#170](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/170) ([`97cb1bb`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/97cb1bb)) - Collapse non-verbose CLI diagnostics to the top 3 rules so the
  default scan output stays scannable on large projects; `--verbose`
  restores the full listing.

- [#172](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/172) ([`2a1b0ae`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/2a1b0ae)) - Tighten state-and-effects rules against false positives across the
  rules-of-hooks / handler-detection / render-reachable code paths.

- [#174](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/174) ([`4fb4d27`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/4fb4d27)) - Forward `reactMajorVersion` through the programmatic `diagnose()`
  entry point so embedders get the same React-19 rule gating the CLI
  uses.

- [#177](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/177) ([`01c38a7`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/01c38a7)) - Harden rules against prototype-pollution false positives and quiet
  the adopt-config noise introduced in `d71a6bf` when the user's
  config contains unknown rules.

## 0.0.47

### Patch Changes

- 6a0e6d6: chore(react-doctor): bump oxlint to ^1.62.0

  Pulls in oxlint v1.61.0 + v1.62.0 improvements (additional Vue rules,
  jest/vitest rule splits, autofix for prefer-template, no-unknown-property
  support for React 19's precedence prop, jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid attribute
  settings, and various correctness fixes). The release-line breaking
  changes are internal Rust API only - oxlint's CLI and config schema
  are unchanged.

- dbf200d: fix(react-doctor): filter React Compiler rules to those the loaded `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` actually exports

  Follow-up to the #141 fix in 0.0.46. The peer range `^6 || ^7` allows
  v6.x of `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, which doesn't expose the
  `void-use-memo` rule (added in v7). When a v6 user had React
  Compiler detected, oxlint failed with
  `Rule 'void-use-memo' not found in plugin 'react-hooks-js'`. The
  config now introspects the loaded plugin's `rules` map and only
  enables `react-hooks-js/*` entries that the installed version
  actually exports - so future rule additions or removals can no
  longer crash a scan.

## 0.0.46

### Patch Changes

- c13a8df: fix(react-doctor): skip React Compiler rules when `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` isn't installed

  When a project had React Compiler detected but the optional peer
  `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` was not installed, oxlint failed with
  `react-hooks-js not found` because the React Compiler rules were
  emitted into the config without the corresponding plugin entry.
  Gate `REACT_COMPILER_RULES` on successful plugin resolution so a
  missing optional peer silently skips them instead of crashing the
  scan (#141).

## 0.0.45

### Patch Changes

- 6b07924: `react-doctor install` now delegates skill installation to
  [`agent-install`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agent-install) `0.0.4`,
  which natively models **54 supported coding agents** (up from the 8 we
  previously hand-rolled).

  Behavior changes:

  - **Detection** is now the union of CLI binaries on `$PATH` (the previous
    signal) and config dirs in `$HOME` (`~/.claude`, `~/.cursor`,
    `~/.codex`, `~/.factory`, `~/.pi`, etc.). This catches agents the user
    has run at least once even if the CLI is no longer on `$PATH`, and vice
    versa.
  - **All 8 originally documented agents stay supported**: Claude Code,
    Codex, Cursor, Factory Droid, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode, Pi.
  - **46 newly supported agents** via upstream `agent-install@0.0.4`:
    Goose, Windsurf, Roo Code, Cline, Kilo Code, Warp, Replit, OpenHands,
    Qwen Code, Continue, Aider Desk, Augment, Cortex, Devin, Junie, Kiro
    CLI, Crush, Mux, Pochi, Qoder, Trae, Zencoder, and many more.
  - **Bug fix**: malformed `SKILL.md` frontmatter now surfaces as an error
    instead of a silent "installed for ..." success with zero files
    written. Build-time validation in `vite.config.ts` also catches this
    before publish.

## 0.0.44

### Patch Changes

- [`57467cd`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/57467cd) - Patch follow-up to the 0.0.43 ignore-respecting refactor: misc
  rough edges in the new ignore-pattern collector and inline-disable
  matcher.

- **Respect existing eslint / oxlint / prettier ignores by default.** React Doctor now honors `.gitignore`, `.eslintignore`, `.oxlintignore`, `.prettierignore`, and `.gitattributes` `linguist-vendored` / `linguist-generated` annotations, plus inline `// eslint-disable*` and `// oxlint-disable*` comments. Previously inline disable comments were neutralized so react-doctor saw through every prior suppression - this surprised users who had `eslint-disable` in place for legitimate reasons. **Behavior change:** existing users may see fewer findings (previously-suppressed code is now correctly suppressed). To restore the old "audit everything" behavior, set `"respectInlineDisables": false` in `react-doctor.config.json` or pass `--no-respect-inline-disables` on the CLI.
- **Internals:** the ignore-pattern collector now writes a single combined `--ignore-path` file rather than passing N `--ignore-pattern` args; this removes a `baseArgs`-length pressure point that could shrink batch sizes on large diffs. Boolean config fields (`lint`, `deadCode`, `verbose`, `customRulesOnly`, `share`, `respectInlineDisables`) are now coerced from the common `"true"` / `"false"` JSON-string typo at config-load time, with a warning. The `parseOxlintOutput` "no files to lint" workaround is now locale-agnostic (it skips any noise before the first `{`). The non-git audit-mode fallback walks the project tree directly instead of silently no-op'ing when `git grep` isn't available. New regression suite covers all of the above end-to-end.

## 0.0.42

### Patch Changes

- 79fb877: Fix `Dead code detection failed (non-fatal, skipping)` (#135). The plugin-failure detector now walks the error cause chain, matches Windows-style paths, plugin configs without a leading directory, and parser errors, so knip plugin loading errors are recovered from in more environments. The retry loop also now surfaces the original knip error after exhausting attempts (previously could throw a generic `Unreachable` error) and only disables knip plugin keys it actually recognizes. Dead-code and lint failures are now reported with the full cause chain instead of a single wrapped `Error loading …` line.
- 391b751: Fix knip step ignoring workspace-local config in monorepos (#136). When a workspace owns its own knip config (`knip.json`, `knip.jsonc`, `knip.ts`, etc.), `runKnip` now runs knip with `cwd = workspaceDirectory` so the config is discovered, instead of running from the monorepo root with `--workspace` and silently falling back to knip's defaults - which mass-flagged every file as `Unused file` for setups like TanStack Start whose entry layout doesn't match the defaults. Behavior for monorepos with a root-level `knip.json` containing a `workspaces` mapping is unchanged.

## 0.0.41

### Patch Changes

- [`1fdc9a0`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/1fdc9a0) - Patch follow-up to the 0.0.39 browser-entrypoint work: misc
  bundling fixes for the now-removed `react-doctor/browser` and
  `react-doctor/worker` subpath exports.

## 0.0.40

### Patch Changes

- [`874f7bc`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/874f7bc) - Publishing-pipeline retry of 0.0.39 (no code delta).

## 0.0.39

### Patch Changes

- [#134](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/134) ([`7da4ce4`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/7da4ce4)) - Fix `TypeError: issues.files is not iterable` crash during dead-code
  detection. Knip 6.x returns `issues.files` as an `IssueRecords`
  object instead of a `Set<string>`. The dead-code pass now handles
  both shapes (and arrays) defensively.

- [`5238e7b`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/5238e7b) / [`061a794`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/061a794) - Add the `react-doctor/browser` entrypoint and a `diagnoseBrowser` /
  `processBrowserDiagnostics` API so the website's in-browser
  demo can run the same scoring + rule pipeline as the CLI without
  shelling out. Shared diagnose helpers and the browser scorer are
  extracted so bundles can omit the proxy-fetch path. (The browser
  surface was later removed in 0.1.0 - see that section.)

- [`b5519b6`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/b5519b6) - Inject the browser scorer at build time so the bundled
  `react-doctor/browser` output omits the proxy-fetch / Node-only score
  path.

## 0.0.38

### Patch Changes

- [`8b0485a`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/8b0485a) - GitHub Action improvements (input validation + step output cleanups),
  clickable file paths in CLI diagnostic output (terminal hyperlinks
  via OSC-8), and a website hydration fix.

- [`bb5188f`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/bb5188f) - Document every config option supported by `react-doctor.config.json`
  in the README.

- [`100731c`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/100731c) - `install-skill` and `detect-agents` formatting fixes so CI's
  `format:check` step stays green.

## 0.0.37

### Patch Changes

- [`f1bd776`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/f1bd776) - Republish 0.0.36 after a botched skill payload - the
  `install-skill` SKILL.md frontmatter was malformed and the prior
  publish shipped an unusable skill. No code delta vs 0.0.36 beyond
  the SKILL.md regeneration.
