  "no-mutable-in-deps":
    "Read mutable values (`location.pathname`, `ref.current`) inside the effect body instead of in the deps array, or subscribe with `useSyncExternalStore`. Mutations to these don't trigger re-renders, so listing them in deps doesn't make the effect react to changes",

  "no-effect-chain":
    "Compute as much as possible during render (e.g. `const isGameOver = round > 5`) and write all related state inside the event handler that originally fires the chain. Each effect link adds an extra render and makes the code rigid as requirements evolve",

  "no-event-trigger-state":
    "Delete the trigger state (`useState(null)` plus the `useEffect` that watches it) and call the side-effect (`post(...)` / `navigate(...)` / `track(...)`) directly inside the event handler that previously called the setter. State should not exist purely to schedule effect runs",
