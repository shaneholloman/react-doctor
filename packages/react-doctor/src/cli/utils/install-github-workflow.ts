// every PR still gets the full report (sticky comment, inline review comments,
// a commit-status score). The push trigger scans the repo's actual default
// branch (`master`, `develop`, …) — not a hardcoded `main`. The inline YAML
// comments give a new user one-line explanations of each trigger and show how
// to graduate the gate (uncomment `with:` and set `blocking: error`), without
// forcing them off to the docs site to learn the basics. The action itself is
// pinned to the floating major `@v2` (never `@main`, per the supply-chain
// guidance in AGENTS.md): `@main` would run whatever HEAD points to with
// `pull-requests: write` granted.
