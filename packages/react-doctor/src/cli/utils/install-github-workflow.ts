  # Scans \`main\` on every push so you get a health-score trend on the
  # default branch — useful for tracking the overall number commit-by-commit
  # and catching regressions that slipped past PR review. PR-specific steps
  # (the sticky summary comment) are skipped automatically on \`push\` events.
  # Comment this block out if you only want PR-time scans.

permissions:
  # \`actions/checkout\` needs this to read the repo source.
  contents: read
  # Two uses: (1) reads the PR's changed-file list so the scan only checks
  # what the PR touched (faster, scoped to the diff), and (2) posts/updates
  # the sticky React Doctor summary comment on the PR. Downgrade \`write\` to
  # \`read\` to keep the changed-file scan but disable comment posting.
  pull-requests: write
  # The sticky-comment step uses GitHub's \`issues.createComment\` /
  # \`issues.updateComment\` endpoints — those are the same APIs that back PR
  # comments (PRs are issues under the hood). Not exercised on \`push\`
  # events, so safe to drop if you only run on \`main\`.
  issues: write
  # Lets the action publish a commit status with the score + error/warning
  # counts (links to the run). This is how a \`push\` to \`main\` surfaces its
  # result, since the PR comment is skipped off pull requests. Drop it to
  # disable the status (or set \`commit-status: false\` below).
  statuses: write

# Cancels any in-flight scan for the same PR (or branch, on push) the moment
# a new commit arrives, so reviewers only ever see the latest run.
