// Sets React Doctor up to scan every pull request: writes the GitHub Actions
// workflow + adds a `doctor` package script (which runs
// `npx react-doctor@latest`, no local dep required). The local dev-dep install
// isn't called from this path: nothing here needs it, and on pnpm with a beta
// channel it noisily trips the supply-chain trust guard for zero user benefit.
// Users who want a pinned local copy go through the `react-doctor install`
// command. Resolves the nearest package root first so a nested scan directory
// doesn't drop the workflow in the wrong place. The script step throws on a
// read-only / permission-denied FS, so it's guarded: a failed setup must never
// crash a scan that already succeeded.
//
// When the workflow is freshly written AND the user has `gh` installed,
// `openWorkflowPullRequest` commits the YAML on a dedicated branch and opens a
// PR for review — that matches the "everything else lands as a reviewable PR"
// mental model teams already have for CI changes, instead of silently dropping
// a top-level workflow file into their working tree. On any failure (gh
// missing, not authenticated, push refused, …) we fall back to `git add`ing the
// file so it at least shows up in the user's next `git status` / commit instead
// of becoming an orphan untracked path.
//
// Returns whether a workflow was freshly written, so callers can record
// accurate activation telemetry.
