// HACK: React 19+ deprecated `forwardRef` (refs are now regular props on
// function components) and `useContext` (replaced by the more flexible
// `use()`). Catches both named imports (`import { forwardRef } from "react"`)
// AND member access on namespace/default imports (`React.forwardRef`,
// `React.useContext` after `import React from "react"` or
// `import * as React from "react"`).
//
// Stored as a Map (not a plain object) because plain-object lookups inherit
// from `Object.prototype` — `messages["constructor"]` returns the native
// `Object` function, which is truthy and would silently false-positive on
// `import { constructor } from "react"` or `React.toString()`. Maps return
// `undefined` for missing keys with no prototype fall-through.
