Your agent writes bad React, this catches it.

React Doctor deterministically scans your codebase and finds issues across state & effects, performance, architecture, security, and accessibility.

Works for all React frameworks and libraries - Next.js, Vite, TanStack, React Native, Expo, you name it.

## Install

### 1. Quick start

Run this at your project root to get an audit.

```bash
npx react-doctor@latest
```

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07cc88d9-9589-44c3-aa73-5d603cb1c570

On a large repo, add `--experimental-parallel` to fan the scan out across your CPU cores:

```bash
npx react-doctor@latest --experimental-parallel
```

React Doctor's rules run as oxlint JS plugins, which are single-threaded per process, so the scan scales nearly linearly with the number of worker processes — typically 3–4x faster on large codebases. Pass `--experimental-parallel <n>` to cap the worker count, or set `REACT_DOCTOR_PARALLEL=<n>` (handy in CI). Diagnostics are identical to a serial run.

### 2. Install for agents

Once you have an audit, you can install the skill for your coding agent to learn from the issues and fix them in the future.

```bash
npx react-doctor@latest install
```

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, and many more.

### 3. Run in CI (GitHub Actions) for your team

[![GitHub Action](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Action-React%20Doctor-000000?style=flat&labelColor=000000&logo=githubactions&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/react-doctor)

Add the reusable GitHub Action from Marketplace to scan every pull request, show inline annotations, and leave findings where reviewers already look.

```yaml
name: React Doctor

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

concurrency:
  group: react-doctor-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  react-doctor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: millionco/react-doctor@main
```

React Doctor scans the files changed in the pull request, emits inline annotations, blocks on error-level findings, and updates one sticky PR comment with the score and issue summary. The built-in GitHub token is used automatically; no secret or PAT is required. On forked PRs where GitHub withholds write permissions, the scan and annotations still run, but the sticky comment may be skipped.

**Permissions:** set `permissions: { contents: read, pull-requests: write }` so React Doctor can read the pull request's changed files for a changed-files-only scan and post the sticky summary comment. If `pull-requests: read` is unavailable (for example on fork PRs or with a restricted default token), the action degrades gracefully to a full-project scan instead of failing.

### 4. Configure rules in `react-doctor.config.json`

Point the `$schema` key at `https://react.doctor/schema/config.json` to get autocomplete, hover docs, and typo warnings for every option in any editor that understands JSON Schema.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://react.doctor/schema/config.json",
  "lint": true,
}
```
