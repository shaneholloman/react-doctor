Your agent writes bad React, this catches it.

One command scans your codebase and outputs a **0 to 100 health score** with actionable diagnostics.

Works with Next.js, Vite, and React Native.

### [See it in action →](https://react.doctor)

## Install

Run this at your project root:

```bash
npx -y react-doctor@latest .
```

You'll get a score (75+ Great, 50 to 74 Needs work, under 50 Critical) and a list of issues across state & effects, performance, architecture, security, accessibility, and dead code. Rules toggle automatically based on your framework and React version.

## Install for your coding agent

Teach your coding agent React best practices so it stops writing the bad code in the first place.

```bash
npx -y react-doctor@latest install
```

You'll be prompted to pick which detected agents to install for. Pass `--yes` to skip prompts.

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, and 50+ other agents.

## GitHub Actions

A composite action ships with this repository. Drop it into `.github/workflows/react-doctor.yml`:

```yaml
name: React Doctor

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write # required to post PR comments

jobs:
  react-doctor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # required for `diff`
      - uses: millionco/react-doctor@main
        with:
          diff: main
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

When `github-token` is set on `pull_request` events, findings are posted (and updated) as a PR comment. The action also exposes a `score` output (0–100) you can use in subsequent steps.

**Inputs:** `directory`, `verbose`, `project`, `diff`, `github-token`, `fail-on` (`error` / `warning` / `none`), `offline`, `node-version`. See [`action.yml`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/blob/main/action.yml) for full descriptions.

Prefer not to add a marketplace action? The bare `npx` form works too:

```yaml
- run: npx -y react-doctor@latest --fail-on warning
```

## Configuration

Create a `react-doctor.config.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "ignore": {
    "rules": ["react/no-danger", "jsx-a11y/no-autofocus"],
    "files": ["src/generated/**"],
    "overrides": [
      {
        "files": ["components/modules/diff/**"],
        "rules": ["react-doctor/no-array-index-as-key", "react-doctor/no-render-in-render"]
      },
      {
        "files": ["components/search/HighlightedSnippet.tsx"],
        "rules": ["react/no-danger"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Three nested keys, three layers of granularity — pick the narrowest one that fits:

- **`ignore.rules`** silences a rule across the whole codebase.
- **`ignore.files`** silences **every** rule on the matched files (use sparingly — it loses coverage for unrelated rules).
- **`ignore.overrides`** silences only the listed rules on the matched files, leaving every other rule active. This is what you want when a single file (or glob) legitimately needs an exemption from one or two rules but should still be scanned for everything else.

You can also use the `"reactDoctor"` key in `package.json`. CLI flags always override config values.

React Doctor respects `.gitignore`, `.eslintignore`, `.oxlintignore`, `.prettierignore`, and `linguist-vendored` / `linguist-generated` annotations in `.gitattributes`. Inline `// eslint-disable*` and `// oxlint-disable*` comments are honored too.

If you have a JSON oxlint or eslint config (`.oxlintrc.json` or `.eslintrc.json`), its rules get merged into the scan automatically and count toward the score. Set `adoptExistingLintConfig: false` to opt out.

#### Optional companion plugins

When the following ESLint plugins are installed in the scanned project (or hoisted in your monorepo), React Doctor folds their rules into the same scan. Both are listed as **optional peer dependencies** — install only what you want.

| Plugin                                                                                                                                          | Adds                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Namespace          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) (v6 or v7)                                               | The React Compiler frontend's correctness rules — fired when a React Compiler is detected in the project.                                                                                                   | `react-hooks-js/*` |
| [`eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect`](https://github.com/nickjvandyke/eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect) (v0.10+) | Complementary effects-as-anti-pattern rules (`no-derived-state`, `no-chain-state-updates`, `no-event-handler`, `no-pass-data-to-parent`, …) that run alongside React Doctor's native State & Effects rules. | `effect/*`         |

### Inline suppressions

```tsx
// react-doctor-disable-next-line react-doctor/no-cascading-set-state
useEffect(() => {
  setA(value);
  setB(value);
}, [value]);
```

When two rules fire on the same line, you have two equivalent options. Comma-separate the rule ids on a single comment:

```tsx
// react-doctor-disable-next-line react-doctor/rerender-state-only-in-handlers, react-doctor/no-derived-useState
const [localSearch, setLocalSearch] = useState(searchQuery);
```

Or stack one comment per rule directly above the diagnostic. Stacked comments are honored as long as nothing but other `react-doctor-disable-next-line` comments sits between them and the target line:

```tsx
// react-doctor-disable-next-line react-doctor/rerender-state-only-in-handlers
// react-doctor-disable-next-line react-doctor/no-derived-useState
const [localSearch, setLocalSearch] = useState(searchQuery);
```

A code line between stacked comments breaks the chain: only the comment immediately above the diagnostic (and any contiguous `react-doctor-disable-next-line` comments stacked on top of it) is honored. If a comment looks adjacent but the rule still fires, run `react-doctor --explain <file:line>` — it reports whether a nearby suppression was found, what rules it covers, and why it didn't apply.

Block comments work inside JSX:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```tsx
{/* react-doctor-disable-next-line react/no-danger */}
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html }} />
```

For multi-line JSX, putting the comment immediately above the opening tag covers the entire attribute list (matching ESLint convention).

## Lint plugin (standalone)

The same rule set ships as both an oxlint plugin and an ESLint plugin, so you can wire it into whichever lint engine your project already runs.

**oxlint** in `.oxlintrc.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "jsPlugins": [{ "name": "react-doctor", "specifier": "react-doctor/oxlint-plugin" }],
  "rules": {
    "react-doctor/no-fetch-in-effect": "warn",
    "react-doctor/no-derived-state-effect": "warn",
  },
}
```

**ESLint** flat config:

```js
import reactDoctor from "react-doctor/eslint-plugin";

export default [
  reactDoctor.configs.recommended,
  reactDoctor.configs.next,
  reactDoctor.configs["react-native"],
  reactDoctor.configs["tanstack-start"],
  reactDoctor.configs["tanstack-query"],
];
```

The full rule list lives in [`oxlint-config.ts`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/blob/main/packages/react-doctor/src/oxlint-config.ts).

## CLI reference

```
Usage: react-doctor [directory] [options]

Options:
  -v, --version           display the version number
  --no-lint               skip linting
  --no-dead-code          skip dead code detection
  --verbose               show every rule and per-file details (default shows top 3 rules)
  --score                 output only the score
  --json                  output a single structured JSON report
  -y, --yes               skip prompts, scan all workspace projects
  --full                  skip prompts, always run a full scan
  --project <name>        select workspace project (comma-separated for multiple)
  --diff [base]           scan only files changed vs base branch
  --staged                scan only staged files (for pre-commit hooks)
  --offline               skip telemetry
  --fail-on <level>       exit with error on diagnostics: error, warning, none
  --annotations           output diagnostics as GitHub Actions annotations
  --explain <file:line>   diagnose why a rule fired or why a suppression didn't apply
  --why <file:line>       alias for --explain
  -h, --help              display help
```

When a suppression isn't working, `--explain <file:line>` (or its alias `--why <file:line>`) reports what the scanner sees at that location, including why a nearby `react-doctor-disable-next-line` didn't apply. The diagnosis distinguishes the common failure modes — adjacent comment for a different rule (use the comma form), a code line between the comment and the diagnostic (the chain is broken), or no nearby suppression at all. The same hint surfaces inline with `--verbose` for every flagged site, and in `--json` output as `diagnostic.suppressionHint`, so a single scan doubles as a suppression audit without a separate flag.

`--json` produces a parsable object on stdout with all human-readable output suppressed. Errors still produce a JSON object with `ok: false`, so stdout is always a valid document.

| `diff`                     | `boolean \| string`              |          |
| `failOn`                   | `"error" \| "warning" \| "none"` | `"none"` |
| `customRulesOnly`          | `boolean`                        | `false`  |
| `share`                    | `boolean`                        | `true`   |
| `textComponents`           | `string[]`                       | `[]`     |
| `rawTextWrapperComponents` | `string[]`                       | `[]`     |
| `respectInlineDisables`    | `boolean`                        | `true`   |
| `adoptExistingLintConfig`  | `boolean`                        | `true`   |

`textComponents` is the broad escape hatch for `rn-no-raw-text` — list components that themselves behave like React Native's `<Text>` (custom `Typography`, `NativeTabs.Trigger.Label`, etc.) and the rule will treat them as text containers regardless of what their children look like.

`rawTextWrapperComponents` is the narrower option for components that are not text elements but safely route string-only children through an internal `<Text>` (e.g. `heroui-native`'s `Button`, which stringifies its children and renders them through a `ButtonLabel`). Listed wrappers suppress `rn-no-raw-text` only when their children are entirely stringifiable. A wrapper with mixed children — e.g. `<Button>Save<Icon /></Button>` — still reports because the wrapper can't safely route raw text alongside a sibling JSX element.

## Node.js API

```js
import { diagnose, toJsonReport, summarizeDiagnostics } from "react-doctor/api";

const result = await diagnose("./path/to/your/react-project");

console.log(result.score); // { score: 82, label: "Great" } or null
console.log(result.diagnostics); // Diagnostic[]
console.log(result.project); // detected framework, React version, etc.
```

`diagnose` accepts a second argument: `{ lint?: boolean, deadCode?: boolean }`.

```js
const report = toJsonReport(result, { version: "1.0.0" });
const counts = summarizeDiagnostics(result.diagnostics);
```

`react-doctor/api` re-exports `JsonReport`, `JsonReportSummary`, `JsonReportProjectEntry`, `JsonReportMode`, plus the lower-level `buildJsonReport` and `buildJsonReportError` builders. See [`packages/react-doctor/src/api.ts`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/blob/main/packages/react-doctor/src/api.ts) for the full types.
