### Patch Changes

- [#38](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/pull/38) [`7279c5c`](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/commit/7279c5cad147c02a503fce5b3111dd0b31cab42d) Thanks [@devin-ai-integration](https://github.com/apps/devin-ai-integration)! - Stop flagging workspace package files imported by sibling workspaces via package subpaths (e.g. `@project/ui/button`) as unused when analyzing a single workspace package — including subpaths resolved through wildcard `exports` patterns (`"./*": "./src/*.tsx"`), nested export conditions, and exports targeting built `dist/` artifacts that exist on disk (entries map back to their `src/` sources) — and treat `vercel.ts`-style deploy-time config files as config files

### Patch Changes

- [#34](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/pull/34) [`3d2e8a1`](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/commit/3d2e8a1b755b6b11a9c627cecec96cf9d4706162) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Add a `reason` field to each `unusedDependencies` finding that names the package and its declaring section (`dependencies` / `devDependencies`), so consumers can surface the specific unused dependency name instead of a generic grouped warning.

## 0.0.21

### Patch Changes

- [#32](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/pull/32) [`c666dbf`](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/commit/c666dbfcfc985dd23d4d2718a3a9480b300d543b) Thanks [@devin-ai-integration](https://github.com/apps/devin-ai-integration)! - Auto-resolve path aliases by default and add a `paths` config option.

  `deslop` now infers cross-workspace `@scope/<dir>` imports from the monorepo layout (so files imported via an alias whose package name or tsconfig didn't cover it are no longer reported as unused), and reads alias mappings from Vite (`resolve.alias`), Jest (`moduleNameMapper`), and Babel (`module-resolver`) configs in addition to the existing tsconfig `paths` and webpack aliases. For anything not auto-detected, the new `paths` option (`--paths "@app/*=src/*"` on the CLI) declares explicit mappings.

- [#32](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/pull/32) [`c666dbf`](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/commit/c666dbfcfc985dd23d4d2718a3a9480b300d543b) Thanks [@devin-ai-integration](https://github.com/apps/devin-ai-integration)! - Improve path-alias resolution accuracy. When multiple `paths` patterns match an import, the most specific one now wins (e.g. `@/components/*` is preferred over `@/*`), matching TypeScript's own resolution. Import specifiers are also sanitized before resolution — webpack inline-loader prefixes (`raw-loader!./x`), `?query` strings, and `#fragment` hashes are stripped (while Node.js `#subpath` imports are preserved) so their targets are no longer mis-reported as unused.

## 0.0.20

### Patch Changes

- [#30](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/pull/30) [`d284d20`](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/commit/d284d203f8bbbebe5e0d9b885c9332de0801f006) Thanks [@devin-ai-integration](https://github.com/apps/devin-ai-integration)! - Respect `.gitignore` when reporting unused code. Files matching a gitignore rule (e.g. generated/build output) are excluded from `unused-file` and `unused-export` results, but stay in the dependency graph so the real source they import is still counted as used — files imported only by a gitignored module are no longer falsely reported as unused. Personal/global gitignore rules are ignored so results are deterministic across machines, and analysis degrades gracefully (with an info-level note) when `git` is unavailable.

## 0.0.19

### Patch Changes

- [#25](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/pull/25) [`96a2311`](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/commit/96a23119bcaf6aa36b18ef155991514159bd5c8b) Thanks [@barclayd](https://github.com/barclayd)! - Astro's live content collections config (`src/live.config.ts`) is now recognized as an always-used entry point, matching the existing `src/content.config.ts` handling. Previously the file — and every module reachable only through it (live collection loaders, schemas, CMS clients) — was reported as `unused-file`, since Astro loads it by filename convention with no import statement anywhere in the project.

- [#26](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/pull/26) [`18dbfa8`](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/commit/18dbfa8ff174858a4f85c82397126ec24b05cf0f) Thanks [@devin-ai-integration](https://github.com/apps/devin-ai-integration)! - Parallelize file parsing with worker threads for projects with 50+ files, using greedy load-balanced concurrency (auto-detected CPU cores, clamped to [1, 16]). Falls back to sequential parsing on small projects or worker failure.

## 0.0.17

### Patch Changes

- [#23](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/pull/23) [`d83dc37`](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/commit/d83dc373a8ef2f8d22ffbb430ff9234cfef23e2a) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - `detectStalePackages` no longer reports a devDependency as unused when it's referenced in a `package.json` script as a flag argument rather than the leading command — e.g. `jest --testResultsProcessor jest-sonar-reporter` or `--reporters=jest-junit`. The script scan previously matched a package only as the command/binary token; it now also treats any declared package named as a standalone token anywhere in the command (including `@scope/pkg` and `pkg/subpath`) as referenced, while still ignoring tokens that merely contain the name as a substring.

### Patch Changes

- [#21](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/pull/21) [`696b690`](https://github.com/millionco/deslop-js/commit/696b690408a392cdbf3f76daf50949710e4c2ed6) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Normalize collected source paths, analyzer path sets, and graph module paths to POSIX separators so Windows resolver and glob paths remain in the same import graph key space. This prevents reachable files and re-exported symbols from being dropped during dead-code analysis on Windows.
