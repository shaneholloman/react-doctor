/**

 *   2. Load `react-doctor.config.(json|js)` / `package.json#reactDoctor`
 *      if present.
 *   3. Honor `config.rootDir` to redirect the scan to a nested
 *      project root, if configured.
 *   4. Walk into a nested React subproject when the requested
 *      directory has no `package.json` of its own (raises
 *      `AmbiguousProjectError` when multiple candidates exist unless
 *      the caller opts into keeping the wrapper directory).
 *
 * Throws `ProjectNotFoundError` when neither the requested directory
 * nor any discoverable nested project has a `package.json`.
 *
 * Before this helper existed, the same three-step dance was reproduced
 * in `api/diagnose.ts`, `react-doctor/inspect.ts`, and the CLI's
 * `cli/commands/inspect.ts` — each loading the config independently
 * (the orchestrator's `Config.layerNode` then loads it a fourth time
 * via its own cache). Routing through `resolveScanTarget` keeps every
 * shell in agreement on what "the scan directory" means.
