 * OOM / killed by signal). When a single-file batch still fails with
 * a splittable error, the file is recorded into a dropped-files list
 * (surfaced via `onPartialFailure`) so JSON-mode consumers see WHICH
 * files were skipped instead of silently losing them.
 *
 * Errors that aren't splittable (oxlint config crash, JS plugin
 * resolution failure, etc.) propagate to the caller — the
 * `runOxlint` retry-without-extends fallback re-spawns this loop
 * with a slimmer config in that case.
