 * - `score` — diagnostics shipped to the React Doctor score API
 *   (or counted toward local score calculations).
 * - `ciFailure` — diagnostics that count toward the `--fail-on` exit
 *   code gate. A diagnostic excluded from this surface never fails the
 *   build, regardless of severity.
 *
 * Defaults: design rules (tag `"design"`) are excluded from `prComment`,

 * React findings. They remain in `cli` so locally-running developers
 * still see the suggestion when they touch the file.
