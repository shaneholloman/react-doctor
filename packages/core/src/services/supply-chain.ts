/**
 * `SupplyChain` scores the project's direct dependencies against Socket.dev's
 * free, keyless PURL endpoint — the same lookup Socket Firewall's free tier
 * (`sfw`) performs — and streams a diagnostic for each dependency whose
 * Socket score falls below the configured `supplyChain.minScore`.
 *
 * Runs by default (one network request per dependency); the orchestrator
 * provides `layerOf([])` only when the user opts out via
 * `supplyChain.enabled: false`, and always skips it in `--diff` / `--staged`
 * mode (dependency health is a whole-project property).
 * The underlying `checkSupplyChain` Effect is total/fail-open — per-package
 * timeouts and network failures recover to "skip" — so the stream never
 * fails, mirroring `DeadCode`'s stream shape so the two compose the same way.
