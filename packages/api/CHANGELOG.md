## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- **New package.** Programmatic `diagnose()` entry point backed by the core `runInspect` streaming orchestrator. Provides typed `ReactDoctorError` failures with `Effect.catchReasons` dispatch for fine-grained error recovery. Replaces the previous `diagnose()` that lived inside `react-doctor` with a standalone package that embedders (Vercel AI Code Review, CI pipelines) can depend on without pulling in the CLI.

- Updated dependencies []:
  - @react-doctor/core@0.2.4
