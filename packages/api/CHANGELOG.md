### Patch Changes

- [#721](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/721) [`d17dc87`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/d17dc87865e059f21534990d0925115db439dc3e) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Add a `defineConfig` helper for authoring a typed `doctor.config.{ts,js,mjs,cjs}` and read `react-doctor.config.json` as a deprecated fallback.

  `defineConfig` is exported from `react-doctor/api` (and `@react-doctor/api` / `@react-doctor/core`) as an identity helper that gives editor autocomplete and type-checking without an explicit `satisfies ReactDoctorConfig` annotation:

  ```ts
  // doctor.config.ts
  import { defineConfig } from "react-doctor/api";

  export default defineConfig({
    lint: true,
    rules: { "react-doctor/no-array-index-as-key": "off" },
  });
  ```

  The pre-migration `react-doctor.config.json` filename is now read as the lowest-priority fallback (after `doctor.config.*` and `package.json#reactDoctor`) instead of being ignored, so an un-migrated config keeps applying. It still emits a deprecation warning nudging a rename, and interactive runs continue to auto-migrate it to `doctor.config.ts`. A present-but-broken legacy file stops config resolution (it won't silently inherit an ancestor repo's config), and `react-doctor rules <...>` migrates a legacy file to `doctor.config.json` on write rather than editing it in place.

  Note: a `react-doctor.config.json` that was previously ignored in non-interactive runs (CI, coding agents, `--json`/`--score`/`--staged`) is now honored again, which can change which rules fire, the score, and PR gating for projects that still have one. Rename it to `doctor.config.json` (or delete it) to avoid surprises.

  - @react-doctor/core@0.2.11

## 0.2.10

### Patch Changes

- Inherit core scan fixes for Preact project detection, React 19.2 capability gating, and dead-code analysis reliability, so programmatic `diagnose()` callers get the same behavior as the CLI.

- Dependency bump: `@react-doctor/core@0.2.10`.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- Use core's exported `layerInspectLive` instead of reimplementing the layer stack, ensuring the API entry point stays in sync with CLI behavior.

- Inherit concurrent lint + dead-code analysis and diagnostic pipeline unification from `@react-doctor/core@0.2.7`.

- Updated dependencies []:
  - @react-doctor/core@0.2.7

- Updated dependencies []:
  - @react-doctor/core@0.2.5

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- **New package.** Programmatic `diagnose()` entry point backed by the core `runInspect` streaming orchestrator. Provides typed `ReactDoctorError` failures with `Effect.catchReasons` dispatch for fine-grained error recovery. Replaces the previous `diagnose()` that lived inside `react-doctor` with a standalone package that embedders (Vercel AI Code Review, CI pipelines) can depend on without pulling in the CLI.

  - @react-doctor/core@0.2.4
