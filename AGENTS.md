## General Rules

- MUST: Use @antfu/ni. Use `ni` to install, `nr SCRIPT_NAME` to run. `nun` to uninstall.
- MUST: Use TypeScript interfaces over types.
- MUST: Keep all types in the global scope.
- MUST: Use arrow functions over function declarations
- MUST: Never comment unless absolutely necessary.
  - If the code is a hack (like a setTimeout or potentially confusing code), it must be prefixed with // HACK: reason for hack
- MUST: Use kebab-case for files
- MUST: Use descriptive names for variables (avoid shorthands, or 1-2 character names).
  - Example: for .map(), you can use `innerX` instead of `x`
  - Example: instead of `moved` use `didPositionChange`
- MUST: Frequently re-evaluate and refactor variable names to be more accurate and descriptive.
- MUST: Do not type cast ("as") unless absolutely necessary
- MUST: Remove unused code and don't repeat yourself.
- MUST: Always search the codebase, think of many solutions, then implement the most _elegant_ solution.
- MUST: Put all magic numbers in `constants.ts` using `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` with unit suffixes (`_MS`, `_PX`).
- MUST: Put small, focused utility functions in `utils/` with one utility per file.
- MUST: Use Boolean over !!.

## Effect v4 Conventions

Built on `effect@4.0.0-beta.70`. See `tmp/effect/.patterns/effect.md` (cloned reference)
and `~/Developer/react-doctor-evals/src/` (the application that pioneered these patterns
for this codebase) for canonical examples.

### Imports

- ALWAYS: `import * as Schema from "effect/Schema"`, `import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"`,
  `import * as Cause from "effect/Cause"`, etc. — one module per import line.
- NEVER: `import { Schema, Effect } from "effect"` — the umbrella import inflates the
  type-resolution graph and contradicts what every other Effect codebase does.

### Errors

- Every fallible service fails with `ReactDoctorError` (`reason: Schema.Union([...])`)
- Each leaf is a `Schema.TaggedErrorClass<Self>()("Tag", { fields })` with a
  `get message()` getter (NOT `message =`) returning a human string.
- Opaque causes use `Cause.pretty(Cause.fail(this.cause))` in the message body.
- Renderers dispatch on `error.reason._tag`, NEVER on `error.message.includes(...)`.
- `formatReactDoctorError(error)` / `isReactDoctorError(error)` / `isSplittableReactDoctorError(error)`
  live in `core/src/errors.ts`. Use them; don't add new error-shape helpers.

### Error dispatch / recovery — v4 idioms

- **`Effect.catchReasons(errorTag, cases, orElse?)`** — the v4-canonical way to
  dispatch on a `Schema.TaggedErrorClass` reason union. Each entry catches one
  reason `_tag`; the optional `orElse` handles unmatched reasons. NEVER write
  manual `if (cause.reason instanceof X)` ladders inside a `catch` block — the
  Effect pipeline gives you exhaustive, type-safe narrowing for free. See
  `inspect.ts → restoreLegacyThrow` and `api/diagnose.ts` for the canonical
  shape.
- **`Effect.catchTag(tag, handler)`** — for a single tagged error (e.g.
  `Effect.catchTag("PlatformError", ...)` in `services/git.ts` to fold the
  `ChildProcess` platform error into a `ReactDoctorError`).
- **`Effect.catch`** (renamed from v3 `Effect.catchAll`) — for catch-all.
- **`Effect.die(error)`** — promote a recovered value into a defect that
  `runPromise` re-throws unchanged. Used in `catchReasons` handlers when the
  programmatic contract still wants the legacy `Error` class on the throw.
- **NEVER** `try/catch` inside `Effect.gen` (v4 hard rule). Wrap the sync
  throw in `Effect.try({ try, catch })` and recover via
  `Effect.orElseSucceed` / `Effect.catch` instead. See
  `render-summary.ts → printSummary` for the canonical shape.

### Generator hygiene

- **`return yield* Effect.fail(...)`** — terminal effects (Effect.fail,
  Effect.interrupt, Effect.die) must be `return yield*` so TypeScript sees
  the unreachable-code property. Bare `yield*` of a terminal lets unreachable
  code accumulate after it. See `services/git.ts` `diffSelection` for examples.
- **`Effect.gen({ self: this }, function* () { ... })`** — v4 changed the
  `self`-bound form. The plain `Effect.gen(function* () { ... })` form is
  unchanged; only class-method generators bound to `this` need the options
  object.
- **`Effect.fnUntraced(function* () { ... })`** — prefer over a function
  whose body is `Effect.gen` when the function is called many times per
  operation (hot path). Cuts tracing overhead. Not currently used in this
  codebase — Git invocations and inspect-pipeline calls run once per scan,
  not in a hot loop.

### Services

- `Context.Service<Self, Interface>()("react-doctor/Name", { make: ... })` — short
  prefix in the identifier (matches react-doctor-evals' `rde/X` shape).
- Service method bodies use `Effect.fnUntraced` for hot paths, `Effect.sync` for
  one-liners. Test layers + orchestration use `Effect.gen`.
- **`Effect.fn("Service.method")`** for non-trivial methods so they surface as
  named spans in OTel traces. Production cost is zero when no tracer layer is
  provided; with `Otlp.layerJson(...)` users see one span per service call.
  Canonical eval pattern (`react-doctor-evals/src/Runner.ts` → every method).
- `Service.of({ ... })` everywhere inside `Layer.succeed` / `make:` — never
  `{ ... } as const`.
- `Layer.effect` when the service has init work (e.g. `Cache.make`); `Layer.succeed`
  when stateless.
- Method takes a single object arg when there are >1 parameters
  (e.g. `Files.readLines({ filePath, rootDirectory })`).

### Layer naming

- `layerNode` for the production Node.js implementation.
- `layerOf(value)` for the test layer that returns a pre-supplied value.
- `layerInMemory(Map)` for filesystem-shaped services backed by an in-memory tree.
- `layerCapture` for the test layer that records calls into a `Ref` exposed via a
  sibling `*Capture` service (e.g. `ReporterCapture`, `ProgressCapture`).
- `layerNoop` for the production layer that has void-return / discard semantics
  (Reporter, Progress). Analyzers (Linter, DeadCode) use `layerOf([])` instead.
- `layerComposite(backends)` for the slot a future second backend plugs into.
- Implementation-specific names: `layerOxlint`, `layerHttp`, `layerNdjson(path)`,
  `layerOra(factory)`.

### Schemas

- Use `Schema.Class<Self>("Name")({ fields })` for wire records.
- Use `Schema.Literals(["a", "b"])` for unions of literals (plural), `Schema.Literal(1)`
  for single literals.
- `Schema.NullOr(X)` for `X | null`; `Schema.optional(X)` for `X?`.
- `Schema.brand("X")` via `.pipe()` for branded primitives.
- Schema for wire types (Diagnostic, JsonReport); interfaces for arg types
  (InspectInput, LintInput) — avoid runtime encode/decode cost on hot paths.

### Ambient config

- Env-var reads + cache paths go through `Context.Reference<T>("react-doctor/X", { defaultValue })`.
  See `core/src/refs.ts`. Tests override via `Layer.succeed(MyRef, ...)`.
- Secrets (API tokens, signing keys) should prefer `Config.redacted("ENV_NAME")` over
  `Context.Reference` so they auto-redact in logs / traces. Group with `Config.all({ ... })`
  at the service constructor when you need several. (Pattern from
  `react-doctor-evals/src/GitHub.ts` — not yet used in this codebase; document
  the convention so the first secret-shaped config does it right.)

### Observability

- Wrap the top-level entry of a multi-step operation in `Effect.withSpan("name", { attributes })`.
  See `core/src/run-inspect.ts → runInspect` for the canonical shape. Attribute
  keys use dotted namespacing (`inspect.directory`, `inspect.isCi`).
- Per-service-method spans come from `Effect.fn("Service.method")` — see Services section
  above. The two compose: `runInspect` is the parent span, every `Service.method` is a child.
- Production observability layer is `layerOtlp` in `core/src/observability.ts`
  (wired into both `inspect()` and `diagnose()`). It's a no-op unless the user
  sets BOTH `REACT_DOCTOR_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (e.g. `https://api.axiom.co`) and
  `REACT_DOCTOR_OTLP_AUTH_HEADER` (e.g. `Bearer <token>`) in the environment.
  When both are set, it provides `Otlp.layerJson({...})` from
  `effect/unstable/observability/Otlp` with `NodeHttpClient.layerUndici` as the
  transport, so every `Effect.fn("Service.method")` span and every top-level
  `Effect.withSpan("...")` ships to the configured backend. Eval reference:
  `react-doctor-evals/src/Observability.ts → layerAxiom`.

### Console / logging

- ALWAYS: `import * as Console from "effect/Console"` and `yield* Console.log(...)` /
  `Console.warn(...)` / `Console.error(...)` from inside renderers, services, and any
  Effect-typed code. Effect's `Console` is a `Context.Reference` whose default sink is
  `globalThis.console`, so the production path is identical to a raw `console.log`
  while remaining swappable for tests / silent mode.
- NEVER: invent a parallel `Logger` / `LoggerWriter` abstraction. The historical custom
  Logger service was removed when the renderer pipeline went Effect-typed; the only
  remaining bridge is `cli/utils/cli-logger.ts`, a thin sync wrapper around
  `Effect.runSync(Console.X)` for imperative CLI helpers that aren't yet `Effect.gen`.
- Silent mode is `Effect.provideService(Console.Console, silentConsole)` (renderer
  pipeline) or `installSilentConsole()` (JSON mode, which monkey-patches the global
  console because the surrounding CLI command body is imperative). Both routes leave
  the underlying `Console.*` Effect intact — there is no `if (silent) return` check
  at any call site.

## Testing

Tests live alongside source in each package's `tests/` directory:

- `packages/core/tests/` — service tests + run-inspect orchestration tests
- `packages/api/tests/` — api shell tests
- `packages/react-doctor/tests/` — CLI + end-to-end fixture tests

Test framework is `vite-plus/test` (the existing vitest wrapper).

Run checks always before committing with:

```bash
pnpm test         # all packages
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm format       # use `format:check` to verify only
pnpm smoke:json-report   # validates the built CLI's JSON output against the schema
```

## Reference reading

- `tmp/effect/.patterns/effect.md` — canonical Effect v4 idioms (cloned for reference,
  gitignored)
- `~/Developer/react-doctor-evals/src/` — sister application this codebase's runtime
  patterns are modeled on (Schemas.ts, Runner.ts, Worker.ts, errors.ts shapes)
